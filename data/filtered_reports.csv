2,Equipment List,BE SURE ALL THE PAPERWORK IS COMPLETE; REGARDLESS OF OTHER; MORE IMPORTANT; DISTRS! ARRIVED AT THE Aircraft TO FIND AN Minimum Equipment List PLACARD IN THE LOGBOOK; FOR OBSERVER JUMP SEAT Inoperative DUE TO BROKEN PART NOT AVAILABLE; BUT ALSO HAD AN Marker MESSAGE OF 'F/Control FLAPS LOCKED' AND 'FLAP WINGTIP BRAKE' IN ADDITION TO A '#2 PACK OVERHEAT' CONDITION WITH HOT AIR POURING INTO THE CABIN. DEALING WITH THESE DELAYED OTHER PREFLT PREPARATIONS AND I FAILED TO NOTICE THE Minimum Equipment List ITEM WAS NOT LISTED ON THE DISPATCH RELEASE AS REQUIRED. PERCEIVED PRESSURE FOR ON-TIME DEP RUSHED COMPLETING PREFLT PREPARATIONS. DEP WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT HAVING THE Minimum Equipment List NUMBER ADDED TO THE DISPATCH RELEASE.
2,Equipment List,"AFTER STARTING BOTH ENGS AND DURING TAXI OUT AT DTW; CREW RECEIVED AN Marker MESSAGE FOR 'ELEC TR2' FAULT. NO ELECTRONIC CHKLIST WITH CORRECTIVE ITEMS WAS GENERATED BY Marker; SO CREW REFED THE COCKPIT OPERATING MANUAL. THE COCKPIT OPERATING MANUAL STATED THAT THE Marker INDICATION WAS FOR CREW AWARENESS ONLY WITH NO CORRECTIVE ACTION REQUIRED. CREW THEN REFERRED TO THE Aircraft Minimum Equipment List AS PER COMPANY PROC. HOWEVER; REF TO THIS DISCREPANCY WAS OVERLOOKED BY THE CREW AT THIS TIME DUE TO DISTRS CAUSED BY RADIOS AND THE TXWYS DURING TAXI OUT. ONCE AT ALT; FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE Minimum Equipment List REVEALED THE PREVIOUSLY OVERLOOKED REF INDICATING THAT THIS ITEM REQUIRED CORRECTIVE ACTION PRIOR TO DISPATCH. DISPATCH WAS THEN CONTACTED OVER COMPANY RADIO AND ADVISED OF THE DISCREPANCY. SUBSEQUENTLY; DISPATCH COORDINATED FOR CORRECTIVE Maintenance UPON Arrival, Arrive AT THE DEST STATION."
2,Equipment List,Flight XYZ OPERATING MCO-SJU ON MAR 1997. PRIOR TO DEP AIRBUS TECHNICAL CONTACTED DISPATCH ASKING FOR APPROVAL FOR Minimum Equipment List ANNUNCIATOR LIGHTS DIM FUNCTION. SINCE I WAS BUSY WITH ANOTHER CALL A DISPATCHER NEAR ME APPROVED THIS Minimum Equipment List FOR Flight XYZ. APPARENTLY THE DISPATCHER WHO APPROVED THE Minimum Equipment List EITHER MISREAD THE Minimum Equipment List OR READ A DIFFERENT Minimum Equipment List. IT WAS DISCOVERED AFTER THE Flight HAD TAXIED OUT THAT THIS Minimum Equipment List REQUIRED THAT THE Flight BE COMPLETED BEFORE NIGHT FALL. Flight DEPARTED MCO AND LANDED UNEVENTFULLY AT SJU AFTER SUNSET.
2,Equipment List,"PRIOR TO PUSHBACK FOR A Flight FROM CMH TO EWR; TECHNICIANS WERE IN THE COCKPIT AND BLOCKED OUR ACCESS UNTIL ABOUT 15-20 MINS PRIOR TO DEP. ONCE IN THE COCKPIT; I REVIEWED THE NEWLY ADDED Minimum Equipment List; NOTED THAT WE WOULD NEED TO ADD IT TO OUR RELEASE; AND CALLED Maintenance BACK OUT AS THE PLACARD THEY INSTALLED WAS NOT WORDED CORRECTLY. WE CONTINUED OUR PREFLT PREPARATIONS; Maintenance CAME AND CORRECTED THE PLACARD AND LEFT AGAIN. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY; WE HAD ANOTHER COMPUTER FAULT AND HAD TO CALL Maintenance AGAIN. DURING ALL THIS WE WERE ALSO WORKING ON OBTAINING CORRECT TKOF RWY DATA AS CMH HAD A SHORTENED RWY. ONE OF THE ENTRY DOOR SLIDES WOULD NOT ARM PROPERLY AND ALL THIS WAS DISTRACTING. THE Minimum Equipment List REQUESTED CERTAIN ACTIONS PRIOR TO DEP AND A LOGBOOK ENTRY WHICH WE COMPLIED WITH BUT WITH ALL THE DISTRS; I FORGOT TO CONTACT DISPATCH TO GET THE Minimum Equipment List ADDED TO OUR RELEASE. WE DISCOVERED THIS En Route TO EWR. THIS TYPE OF MASS Distraction JUST PRIOR TO PUSHBACK IS COMMON. I TRY HARDER THAN ANYONE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE SAFE AND LEGAL; BUT OCCASIONALLY ANYONE CAN MAKE THIS KIND OF MISTAKE. THE DAILY LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF COMPLIANCE WITH FOM; FARS; Minimum Equipment List; ETC; ARE NUMEROUS AND SERIOUS. IN FACT; AN ARGUMENT COULD BE MADE THAT WITH SO MANY LEGAL TECHNICALITIES TO CONSIDER; A (S,'S) Pilot'S TIME TO PROPERLY CONSIDER THE REAL SAFETY FACTORS IS REDUCED. I WOULD ADVOCATE SOME TYPE OF A LEGALITIES CHKLIST TO HELP REMIND US OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS. LET'S FACE IT -- THE REGS ARE INCREASING BY NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY EVERY YR. THIS PROB WILL ONLY GET WORSE. IS THERE A WAY FOR PLTS TO STAY ABSOLUTELY LEGAL ON EVERY Flight? MY ONLY IDEA IS TO REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL CHKLIST OR REQUIRE VERBAL DISPATCH CONTACT PRIOR TO EVERY Flight FOR REVIEW OF Aircraft STATUS; Weather ETC."
2,Equipment List,THIS RPT REFERS TO NON COMPATIBLE Minimum Equipment List DEFERRALS AND WHAT PART THE Flight Crew CAN PLAY TO PREVENT OVERSIGHTS LIKE THIS FROM OCCURRING. ON DEC/XA/97 MY CREW WAS ASSIGNED AN A300 Aircraft TO FLY A REGULAR SCHEDULED Flight FROM JFK; NY; TO BQN; PR. WE WERE INFORMED THAT IN ADDITION TO A DEFERRED Inoperative R THRUST REVERSER THE PLANE ALSO HAD 1 R MAIN WHEEL BRAKE DEACTIVATED AND DEFERRED DUE TO DRAGGING AND OVERHEATING. Maintenance WAS WORKING TO REPAIR THE BRAKE BEFORE DEP. AT DEP TIME Maintenance DETERMINED THAT THE REPAIR COULD NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED AND THE Aircraft WOULD BE DISPATCHED WITH THE ORIGINAL Minimum Equipment List DEFERRALS IN PLACE. THEY RETURNED THE LOGBOOK WITH ALL PROPER SIGNOFFS AND Minimum Equipment List NUMBERS RECORDED. UPON ARRIVING AT OUR DEST; WE WERE INFORMED BY THE COMPANY THAT A MISTAKE HAD BEEN MADE AND THE Aircraft SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED. ACCORDING TO Minimum Equipment List RESTRS THE Aircraft CANNOT BE OPERATED WITH AN Inoperative BRAKE AND AN Inoperative THRUST REVERSER ON THE SAME SIDE. ALTHOUGH THE Flight AND LNDG WERE UNEVENTFUL; THE IMPROPER Minimum Equipment List DEFERMENTS CREATED A TECHNICAL ILLEGALITY. I HOPE IN FUTURE RECURRENT TRAINING CLASSES THAT WE WILL MAKE A POINT OF ENCOURAGING CREWS TO TAKE A MOMENT (EVEN WHEN PRESSING AGAINST DEP SCHEDULE) TO REVIEW THE DEFERRED ITEMS IN THE Minimum Equipment List FOR POSSIBLE RESTRS. MOST Minimum Equipment List ITEMS ARE ONLY A PARAGRAPH OR TWO Longitude BUT PACKED WITH Information. I'LL BET I'LL BE DOING IT.
2,Equipment List,"DURING A PLANE SWAP PREFLT IN LAS THE First Officer  Heading HDG(S) DISCOVERED THAT A Hydraulic Marker System VERT(LY) Vertical INDICATION WAS NOT INDICATING PROPERLY. Maintenance WAS ALREADY ONBOARD THE Aircraft TENDING TO AN EXISTING Minimum Equipment List XXA FOR A BLUE Hydraulic System VERT(LY) Vertical RESERVOIR LOW AIR PRESSURE Marker WARNING FAILURE WHICH REQUIRED THAT THE BLUE RESERVOIR AIR PRESSURE BE VERIFIED AT THE RESERVOIR PRIOR TO DEP. ONCE Maintenance HAD CHKED THE BLUE Hydraulic AIR RESERVOIR PRESSURE THEY WENT TO WORK ON OUR OTHER Marker INDICATION PROB DISCOVERED BY THE First Officer  Heading HDG(S). IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE System VERT(LY) Vertical WAS OPERATING PROPERLY BUT THAT THE Marker Hydraulic PAGE INDICATION WAS NOT INDICATING PROPERLY FOR WHICH THERE WAS Minimum Equipment List XXA RELIEF. THERE WAS A System VERT(LY) Vertical VERIFICATION Check REQUIRED BEFORE DEP THAT Maintenance AND I COMPLETED TOGETHER. THE LOGBOOK WAS SIGNED OFF AND THE Minimum Equipment List ADDED TO OUR Flight RELEASE. WE DEPARTED FOR ONT 1 (S,LY) Hour LATE ARRIVING AT XU00. I ENTERED INTO THE LOGBOOK AN 'Information ONLY' ENTRY THAT THE System VERT(LY) Vertical Check HAD BEEN COMPLETED FOR THE Minimum Equipment List XXA. UPON Arrival, Arrive ANOTHER Minimum Equipment List FOR A Engine HP BLEED VALVE CAME UP; SO BEFORE GOING TO THE HOTEL I WROTE IT UP AND GOT THE DEFERRED PLACARDING INSTALLATIONS (DPI) FROM Maintenance Control. I CHKED MY OTHER WRITE-UPS BEFORE LEAVING FOR THE HOTEL AND NOTED THAT THE Marker INDICATION HAD BEEN PLACARDED BY Maintenance IN LAS AS AN XXA (THE SAME Minimum Equipment List FOR OUR EXISTING XXA Marker BLUE Hydraulic RESERVOIR LOW AIR PRESSURE WARNING Inoperative). I DIDN'T GIVE IT MUCH THOUGHT AT THAT MOMENT AND FIGURED THAT I GOT IT WRONG ON MY Information ONLY WRITE-UP AND CHANGED MY XXB TO AN XXA AND CAUGHT THE VAN TO THE HOTEL. IT WAS NOW XU30. DURING THE RIDE TO THE HOTEL I STARTED TO THINK SOME MORE ABOUT MY WRITE-UP IN LAS AND NOW WASN'T SURE Intermediate Fix IT HAD BEEN PROPERLY CLRED. SO; ONCE AT MY ROOM I CALLED Maintenance Control IN PHX TO VERIFY THE Minimum Equipment List. DISPATCH AND PHX Maintenance Control HAD THE CORRECT XXB Marker INDICATION Minimum Equipment List ON RECORD SO IT BECAME OBVIOUS THEN THAT LAS Maintenance HAD CLRED THE LOGBOOK INCORRECTLY WITH THE OTHER Minimum Equipment List; XXA Marker WARNINGS AND CAUTIONS; THAT WAS ALREADY EXISTING ON THE Aircraft. IN SHORT WE HAD AN EXISTING Minimum Equipment List XXA FOR AN Marker WARNING/CAUTION AND NEEDED AN XXB Marker INDICATIONS Minimum Equipment List BUT INSTEAD GOT ANOTHER XXA PLACARD ON THE LOGBOOK. THERE ARE EXISTING PROCS FOR THE Flight Crew TO DOUBLE Check THIS BUT DUE TO THE (S,LY) Hour OF THE DAY; LAST LEG; SIMILAR Minimum Equipment List NUMBER AND TYPE I FAILED TO CATCH THE MISTAKE UNTIL ONT. OUT I WENT BACK TO THE ARPT. I CONFERRED WITH PHX Maintenance Control AND GOT THE Situation CORRECTED AND GOT BACK TO THE HOTEL AT XW00."
2,Equipment List,Minimum Equipment List WAS CONSULTED IN <Airport  (Domestic)> REGARDING AN Inoperative MECHANICAL; HORIZ First Officer  Heading HDG(S) SEAT Control. Minimum Equipment List STATED '2' DEVICES TO Control HORIZ MOVEMENT INSTALLED '0' REQUIRED FOR DISPATCH; AND THAT THE SEAT COULD BE OPERATED WITH MECHANICAL BACKUP Control. THIS STATEMENT WAS CONFUSING BECAUSE THERE IS ONLY 1 MECHANICAL Control AND 1 ELECTRONIC Control. Maintenance WAS CALLED. THEY CHKED THE WRITE-UP AND Minimum Equipment List AND CONFIRMED Aircraft DISPATCHABILITY VIA THE Minimum Equipment List AND THE ELECTRO-MECHANICAL BACKUP. THEY DETERMINED THE ELECTRICAL Control WAS THE BACKUP. THE ONLY REASON I AM SUBMITTING THIS RPT WAS BECAUSE UPON ARRIVING IN ABC; THE Flight Crew RECEIVING THIS Aircraft REFUSED TO FLY IT; DUE TO THE Minimum Equipment List WRITE-UP. DUE TO THE FACT THE Minimum Equipment List WAS NOT Clear AND HAS BEEN INTERPED DIFFERENTLY AND INCORRECTLY BY MANY; I FELT IT WAS NECESSARY TO FILE THIS RPT.
2,Equipment List,Aircraft WAS DISPATCHED WITH AUTOBRAKES Inoperative. THE First Officer  Heading HDG(S) CONSULTED THE Minimum Equipment List AND READ OUT LOUD THE Flight Crew OPERATING PROCS; AND ALSO MENTIONED A Maintenance PROC (DDG) ASSOCIATED WITH THE Minimum Equipment List. NEITHER OF US PAID PARTICULAR ATTN TO THE 'DDG;' AS THAT IS A Maintenance FUNCTION. ALSO; THE Minimum Equipment List PLACARD IN THE Aircraft LOGBOOK HAS A BOX THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE CHKED Intermediate Fix AN INSPECTION IS REQUIRED BEFORE Flight. THIS BOX WAS NOT CHKED. WE DEPARTED ON TIME; AND WHILE En Route I PAGED BACK THROUGH THE LOGBOOK FOR OTHER REASONS. I ALREADY KNEW THAT THE Maintenance RELEASE HAD BEEN SIGNED IN TPA THAT MORNING AND THAT THE 'DDG' FOR THE Minimum Equipment List HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AT THAT TIME. WHILE PAGING BACK FURTHER; I NOTED THAT A LOG ENTRY DOCUMENTING ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE 'DDG' HAD BEEN MADE PRIOR TO EVERY Flight SINCE THE AUTOBRAKES HAD BEEN PLACED ON Minimum Equipment List. I LOOKED UP THE Minimum Equipment List IN THE BOOK AGAIN; AND; SURE ENOUGH; THAT 'DDG' WAS TO BE DONE PRIOR TO EACH Flight. ALTHOUGH IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF Maintenance TO PERFORM THE PROC; IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO REFUSE THE Aircraft UNTIL THE PROC IS PERFORMED AND DOCUMENTED IN THE LOGBOOK. THIS WAS NOT DONE FOR THIS Flight. CONTRIBUTING TO MY OVERSIGHT WAS THE FACT THAT THE BOX ON THE Minimum Equipment List PLACARD INDICATING THE REQUIREMENT OF A PREFLT 'DDG' WAS NOT CHKED.
2,Equipment List,WE FLEW FROM <Airport  (Domestic)>; US; TO MSP WITH A BOXED Minimum Equipment List ITEM NOT ON THE RELEASE. WE WERE BUSY TAKING CARE OF 2 WRITE-UPS ON THE Aircraft ALONG WITH REVIEWING THE NONSTANDARD DEP PROCS OUT OF <Airport  (Domestic)> AND OVERLOOKED THE BOXED Minimum Equipment List ITEM THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE RELEASE.
2,Equipment List,ON AUG/FRI/00; I WAS ASSIGNED Aircraft XYZ TO COMPLETE TROUBLESHOOTING AND REPAIRS TO THE INFLT WHEEL BRAKING System VERT(LY) Vertical. ALL REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED PER OUR Maintenance MANUAL AND I CLRED Minimum Equipment List 32-17. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A NOSEWHEEL BRAKING PROB ON THIS Aircraft OR THAT THE NOSE BRAKES WERE REMOVED. I HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A POSSIBLE SAFETY OR RULE VIOLATION. I BELIEVE THAT THE Minimum Equipment List PROCS FOR 32-17 ARE UNCLR IN THIS CASE.
2,Equipment List,"AFTER Engine START; WE RECEIVED MESSAGE 'BRAKING STEERING Control UNIT #1 FAULT.' Captain WAS IN A HURRY AND STATED 'Intermediate Fix IT DOESN'T Clear; WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT IN <Airport  (Domestic)>.' THERE WAS A Longitude LINE FOR DEP AND SINCE WE WERE ALREADY LATE; I SUGGESTED WE GIVE Maintenance A CALL. I WAS TALKING WITH Maintenance Control ON #2 COM WHILE Captain USED #1 COM FOR (S,ED Control. I TRIED CYCLING 2 BREAKERS AND ANTISKID/NOSEWHEEL STEERING SWITCH PER Maintenance Control WITH NO REMEDY. THE FAULT REMAINED ON Marker. WHILE Maintenance Control WAS TRYING TO ISSUE A TEMPORARY Minimum Equipment List WE USE; WE WERE CLRED INTO Position ON THE RWY. THE Captain ANSWERED ALL Air Traffic Control RADIO CALLS AND TOLD ME Intermediate Fix I DIDN'T GET THE Minimum Equipment List RELEASE WE COULD GET IT IN THE AIR. I THEN ASKED Maintenance Control Intermediate Fix WE COULD PICK IT UP AIRBORNE AND WAS TOLD 'NEGATIVE.' I TOLD THE Captain THAT WE COULDN'T DEPART WITHOUT THE ISSUANCE OF THE TEMPORARY Minimum Equipment List; BUT BY THIS TIME WE HAD PUSHED THE THRUST LEVERS FORWARD AND SAID 'WE'RE GOING; IT'S OK.' I INCORRECTLY ASSUMED THE FAULT HAD CLRED AND WE WERE GOOD TO GO. I QUICKLY PUNCHED OFF OF #2 AND JOINED THE Captain ON COM #1 FOR TKOF ROLL. THE FAULT HAD NOT CLRED AND IN HIS RUSH; THE Captain DECIDED TO DEPART ANYWAY. THE FAULT REMAINED ON Marker STATUS PAGE FOR OUR ENTIRE Flight TO DEST. THE Captain DIDN'T EVEN WRITE UP DISCREPANCY AT OUR HOME BASE WITH FULL Maintenance. AS WE WERE DONE FLYING; I INFORMED INCOMING CREW OF FAULT AND International Civil Aviation Mechanic THAT CAME ON BOARD TO Clear ANOTHER TEMPORARY Minimum Equipment List. CAUSE: CAPTS RUSH TO GET HOME WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. HE DID NOT WANT TO TAKE 5 MINS NEEDED TO COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION PRIOR TO TKOF. MY Position AS First Officer  Heading HDG(S) AND NOT BEING ASSERTIVE ENOUGH TO STOP HIM PRIOR TO HIM APPLYING TKOF THRUST. PREVENT RECURRENCE: Captain TO FOLLOW COMPANY PROCS REGARDING Maintenance ISSUES AND TAXIING ONTO ACTIVE RWY WITHOUT BOTH PLTS ON #1 COM (Air Traffic Control). MYSELF First Officer  Heading HDG(S): MORE ASSERTIVE; SOMEHOW COMMUNICATE TO Captain THAT I WASN'T READY TO DEPART AND PREVENT HIM FROM TAKING OFF. BETTER Cockpit Resource Management."
2,Equipment List,"PREVIOUS Flight ARRIVED FROM <Airport  (Domestic)> WITH AN Minimum Equipment List SIGNED OFF. THIS Minimum Equipment List REFERRED TO 1 BRAKE BEING Inoperative AND DISCONNECTED. AFTER READING THE Minimum Equipment List PROCS; THE (S,'S) Pilot PROCS WERE SPECIFIED IN THE PROCS COLUMN. ALL (S,'S) Pilot-REQUIRED STEPS WERE TAKEN AND ALL CLOSE-OUT PENALTIES WERE APPLIED. Maintenance WAS TO INSPECT THE LNDG GEAR GENERATORS. THIS WAS NOTED ON THE PREVIOUS LOG PAGE AS BEING PERFORMED IN <Airport  (Domestic)>. NEITHER THE LOG PAGE NOR DID THE Minimum Equipment List PAGE STATE A Maintenance SIGNOFF WAS REQUIRED BEFORE EACH Flight. Maintenance FAILED TO SIGN OFF THE LOGBOOK STATING THEY HAD CHKED THE LNDG GEAR TAC GENERATORS. Maintenance Control WAS CONTACTED IN <Airport> AND I WAS ADVISED THAT Maintenance Control DROPPED THE BALL AND DID NOT NOTIFY ZZZ2 THAT THEY WERE TO PERFORM THE INSPECTION. Aircraft WAS INSPECTED AND SIGNED OFF. Minimum Equipment List SHOULD HAVE STATED IN THE (S,'S) Pilot COLUMN THAT A SIGNED OFF LOG SHEET BE REQUIRED BEFORE EACH Flight. IT DID NOT."
2,Equipment List,"Minimum Equipment List MISCUE. ON Flight FROM <Airport  (Domestic)> TO <Airport> ON JAN/WED/02; I FLUBBED AN Minimum Equipment List ITEM. SPECIFICALLY DURING TAXI OUT WE RECEIVED A MESSAGE STATING Resolution Advisory #1 FAULT ACCOMPANIED BY THE Captain'S RADIO ALTIMETER TAPE 'OFF' FLAG COMING INTO VIEW. THE <Airport  (Domestic)> Weather AT THE TIME WAS 1 MI VISIBILITY; MODERATE RAIN; AND THE TAXI SURFACES WERE VERY WET. I MENTION THAT BECAUSE THERE IS A STATEMENT IN THE A300'S Flight MANUAL THAT SAYS THAT DURING Weather SUCH AS WE WERE EXPERIENCING THE RADIO ALTIMETER TAPES COULD FLUCTUATE. WE HAD IN FACT EXPERIENCED THAT ANOMALY DURING OUR TAXI IN TO THE GATE ON Arrival, Arrive. AFTER CHKING Minimum Equipment List WE DETERMINED THAT WE COULD PLACARD THE ITEM; BUT THE ONLY QUESTION I COULDN'T RESOLVE WAS COMPLYING WITH THE Minimum Equipment List REQUIREMENTS. WE CONSULTED <Airport  (Domestic)> Maintenance AND THE TECHNICIAN INITIALLY THOUGHT WE WERE EXPERIENCING THE FLUCTUATION ISSUE. AFTER AMPLIFIED CLARIFICATION FROM ME; THE INITIAL READ FROM <Airport  (Domestic)> Maintenance WAS THAT WE NEEDED TO RETURN TO THE GATE. AS WE APCHED THE GATE AREA Maintenance ADVISED US THAT WE COULD PLACARD THE ITEM AND COMPLY WITH THE Minimum Equipment List ITEMS. FORTHRIGHTLY STATED; I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE PROVISIONS OF THE Minimum Equipment List COUPLED WITH ANOTHER SECTION OF OUR MANUAL PERMITTING THE PLACARDING OF THE ITEM. WE DID RETURN TO THE GATE; Maintenance FIXED THE ITEM WITH A CIRCUIT BREAKER RESET AND WE DEPARTED <Airport  (Domestic)>. DURING THE Flight TO <Airport>; I REVIEWED THE PROVISION OF THE Minimum Equipment List AND DISCOVERED MY ERROR. TO SAY I FELT LIKE A TOTAL DUMMY WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT. HOWEVER; AS I'VE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT MY CAREER; Intermediate Fix YOU'RE NOT LEARNING SOMETHING EACH DAY THAT ONE FLIES; THEN IT'S PROBABLY TIME TO HANG UP THE UNIFORM. IN MY DEFENSE; THE Maintenance TECHNICIAN AT <Airport  (Domestic)> WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT FAMILIAR WITH OUR Minimum Equipment List. THERE WAS NO MENTION MADE TO ME REGARDING ITS BEING INCLUDED IN THE Minimum Equipment List. ALL HE STATED WAS THAT WE HAD THE Minimum Equipment List CHKLIST ON BOARD THE AIRPLANE. HAD HE REFERRED ME TO THE Minimum Equipment List I WOULD HAVE SEEN WHAT I SUBSEQUENTLY SAW DURING THE Flight TO <Airport> AND WE WOULD HAVE ADDRESSED THE ISSUE ON THE TXWY WHERE WE WERE PARKED AND NOT RETURNED TO THE GATE. I ESTIMATE THAT MY ERROR COST US ABOUT 35-40 EXTRA MINS. I CAME TO THAT CONCLUSION BASED UPON THE FACT THAT THE Coordination  Alerting System WITH THE TECHNICIAN; COORDINATING WITH DISPATCH; RESEARCHING THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE Minimum Equipment List ITEM; GIVING ME THE Information THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE PUT ON THE Minimum Equipment List; ETC; WOULD HAVE TAKEN AT LEAST 20-25 MINS. AS IT WAS WE WERE OUT THE SECOND TIME 1 (S,LY) Hour LATER THAN THE ORIGINAL OUT TIME. THAT'S MY STORY."
2,Equipment List,DISPATCHED WITH A FOLLOW-UP REQUIREMENT ON THE Minimum Equipment List CONCERNING YELLOW Hydraulic RESERVOIR PRESSURE. LOGBOOK NOTATION WAS MADE BY MYSELF ENSURING Maintenance'S COMPLIANCE. AFTER FURTHER DISCUSSION WITH First Officer  Heading HDG(S) En Route TO <Airport  (Domestic)> IT WAS DETERMINED FROM THE WORDING IN THE Minimum Equipment List; Maintenance PERSONNEL SHOULD HAVE ENTERED THE NOTATION THEMSELVES. ON SUBSEQUENT LEG; WE ENSURED Maintenance PERSONNEL MADE THE LOGBOOK NOTATION. PROB AROSE BECAUSE OF DEBATABLE LANGUAGE IN THE 'OPS' SECTION OF THE Minimum Equipment List; WHICH I MISINTERPRETED. NO CORRECTIVE ACTION WAS REQUIRED ON THE PART OF Maintenance; ONLY A READING OF A GAUGE; OF WHICH PROC I NOTED. HOWEVER; AFTER A FURTHER REVIEW AND DISCUSSION; WE REALIZED THE MAKING OF THE NOTATION WAS UNDER THE 'Maintenance' SECTION OF Minimum Equipment List. THE 'OPS' SECTION HAD THE 'ENSURING NOTATION WAS MADE' -- NOT 'ENSURING OF PROC.' TO PREVENT REOCCURRENCE; A CLOSER EXAMINATION OF BOTH PARTS; Maintenance AS WELL AS OPS; OF THE Minimum Equipment List SHOULD BE STUDIED.
2,Equipment List,"JUL/TUE/03 HAD TSTMS FORECASTED FROM THE MIDWEST TO THE EAST. THE TSTMS STARTED TO DEVELOP MUCH EARLIER THAN EXPECTED; THEREFORE; CREATED AN EXTREMELY BUSY DAY. SO MUCH SO; EVEN AFTER THE Manager SPLIT OFF SEVERAL SECTIONS; MID SHIFT WORKLOAD WAS CLEARLY PUSHING AN UNMANAGEABLE LEVEL. Flight FROM IAD WAS PREPLANNED WHEN Maintenance CALLED TO DEFER THE #2 BLEED AIR SUPPLY System VERT(LY) Vertical; WHICH REQUIRES FL310 AND NOT TO BE OPERATED IN KNOWN OR FORECASTED ICING. AFTER REVIEWING THE Minimum Equipment List; I ACCEPTED THE DEFERRAL KNOWING I WAS GOING TO REPLAN THE Flight OVERWATER; AVOIDING En Route Weather. I REFILED THE NEW Route  Takeoff TKOF(S) AND ALT AND CALLED OPS TO TALK WITH THE Captain ABOUT THE DEFERRAL AND ADJUSTMENTS TO THE Flight PLAN. HE WAS NOT THERE; SO I SENT A MESSAGE TO THE PLANE WITH THE Information AND CONTINUED WITH MY WORK UNTIL I HEARD FROM HIM Approximately 45 MINS LATER. HE REVIEWED THE Minimum Equipment List AND MY NEW ROUTING AND AGREED WITH THE PLAN. ONCE AIRBORNE; THE Captain SENT ME A MESSAGE STATING THAT Air Traffic Control HAD REROUTED THEM BACK OVER LAND AND HE ACCEPTED IT. I TOLD HIM HE NEEDED TO REFUSE THE ROUTING DUE TO THE Minimum Equipment List RESTR OF FL310 AND THE TSTMS En Route. HE RESPONDED; ASKING Intermediate Fix IT WAS BECAUSE OF ICING. I RE-EVALUATED THE Situation. RADAR SHOWED AN UNAVOIDABLE WALL OF TSTMS FROM GSO S THE DEST. I CHKED WITH METEOROLOGY FOR En Route ICING RETURNING TO IAD AND FOR OUR Arrival, Arrive TIME WE WOULD BE IN THE Clear. I DECIDED; IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY; THE BEST OPTION WAS FOR THE Flight TO RETURN TO IAD. I BRIEFED THE Manager AND SHE AGREED THAT RETURNING TO IAD WAS THE BEST OPTION. AT THAT POINT; THE CREW CALLED ME ON THE RADIO; AND I LET THEM KNOW WE NEEDED TO RETURN TO IAD. THE Flight DID RETURN TO IAD SAFELY AND NOT OVERWT. SUPPLEMENTAL Information FROM ACN 588400: AT NO TIME DID WE EVER EXPERIENCE FLYING IN ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE Clear. WE DEVIATED AROUND ALL Weather AND BURNED OFF FUEL TO ENSURE THAT WE DID NOT MAKE AN OVERWT LNDG. THE RETURN AND LNDG AT IAD WAS UNEVENTFUL."
2,Equipment List,Aircraft #1 Engine FIRE LOOP B FAULT HAD Longitude HISTORY. ON AUG/WED/03; Aircraft REMAINED OVERNIGHT AT <Airport  (Domestic)>. FIELD TECHNICIAN Maintenance Controller CAME TO DIRECT TROUBLESHOOTING. PROCS OUTLINED IN AIRBUS SIL 26-029; PAGE 9L. CORE ZONE PINS WERE SWAPPED; System VERT(LY) Vertical TESTED GOOD. Minimum Equipment List REMOVED AND Aircraft RELEASED FOR SVC. Aircraft OPERATED SEVERAL LEGS AND FAULT RECURRED. ON AUG/THU/03; I WAS ASSIGNED SAME Aircraft TO CONTINUE TROUBLESHOOTING PER SIL 26-029 WITHOUT FIELD TECHNICIAN. CORE ZONE PINS WERE SWAPPED BACK TO ORIGINAL Position AND FIRE DETECTION UNIT PINS WERE SWAPPED. AFTER THE WORK WAS COMPLETED; Maintenance Control NOTIFIED MY LEAD THAT AN 'ETO' [ENGINEERING TECHNICAL ORDER] WAS REQUIRED TO RELEASE THE Aircraft IN THE NEW CONFIGN WHICH THEY DID NOT HAVE. Maintenance Control THEN REQUESTED TO PUT Aircraft WIRING BACK TO ORIGINAL CONFIGN. Aircraft WAS RESTORED BACK TO NORMAL CONFIGN AND RELEASED PER Minimum Equipment List OK ON AUG/THU/03.
2,Equipment List,"OUR Flight INITIALLY PUSHED OFF GATE IN DCA ON TIME; BUT EXPERIENCED A FUEL PUMP FAULT THAT REQUIRED US TO RETURN TO THE GATE FOR Maintenance ATTN. ONCE PROB WAS Minimum Equipment List'ED; WE PUSHED OFF SECOND TIME BY SAME PUSHBACK CREW (Maintenance AND (S,ED AGENT). HOWEVER; THIS TIME THE AGENT EXPERIENCED EXTREME DIFFICULTY UNHOOKING THE TOWBAR AND AFTER NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS; Maintenance INFORMED ME HE WOULD HAVE TO HOP OFF TUG TO HELP HIM. ONCE DISCONNECT WAS FINALLY COMPLETED; BOTH INDIVIDUALS GATE PROPER PUSHBACK/DISCONNECT VERBIAGE AND HAND SIGNALS PRIOR TO A STANDARD WAVE-OFF. WE STARTED BOTH ENGS AND RAN CHKLISTS WHICH IS WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THE NOSEWHEEL STEERING INDICATION. HOWEVER; OUR ATTN WAS INSTEAD DIVERTED TO THE NEW Marker STATUS ITEM OF THE FAULTED FUEL PUMP FROM THE Minimum Equipment List WE CARRIED. WE DID THE PROPER BRAKE AND Flight Control CHKS AND CONTINUED TAXIING Approximately 400 YARDS (ALL STRAIGHT) UNTIL (S,ED CLRED US TO CROSS RWY 15 FOR A RWY 19 DEP. THE FAILURE OF THE Aircraft TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE SLIGHT L ACROSS RWY 15 IMMEDIATELY MADE US REALIZE OUR PROB; SO I IMMEDIATELY STOPPED THE Aircraft ON RWY 15. FORTUNATELY; THIS WAS NOT A BUSY TIME FOR DCA AND OUR Position ON RWY 15 DID NOT IMPACT ANY Significant Meteorological Traffic OR CAUSE ANY DELAY FOR OTHER Aircraft. WE WAITED Approximately 8-10 MINS FOR Maintenance TO BE ESCORTED TO OUR Position; AT WHICH POINT THEY REMOVED THE PIN AND WE CONTINUED OUR TAXI AND SUBSEQUENT TKOF WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. IT IS Clear THAT NUMEROUS FACTORS CAUSED BOTH THE (S,ED CREW AND Flight CREW TO MISS THE FACT THAT THE NOSEWHEEL STEERING PIN HAD NOT BEEN REMOVED. FOR (S,ED CREW; A COMBINATION OF A REPETITIVE TASK; THE UNDERLYING PUSH TO KEEP THE Flight ON TIME FOLLOWING OUR 30 MIN DELAY FOR THE FUEL PUMP Minimum Equipment List; THEN COUPLE THAT WITH THE DIFFICULTIES THEY BOTH EXPERIENCED UNHOOKING TOWBAR CAUSED THEM TO MISS IT. Flight CREW ALSO FAILED TO NOTICE IT AT THE APPROPRIATE SPOT ON CHKLIST WHERE CHKING Marker STATUS IS REQUIRED BECAUSE FUEL PUMP FAULT REQUIRED US TO DIVERT OUR ATTN TO THE REQUIRED STATUS PAGE FOR REVIEW. NO DOUBT; THE SAME UNDERLYING TIME PRESSURE PLAYED A ROLE; THOUGH SUBCONSCIOUSLY; AS THE PRESSURE OF BEING LATE CANNOT TOTALLY BE DISCOUNTED."
2,Equipment List,IT WAS RPTED TO ME BY A Flight ATTENDANT THAT THE AFT LAVATORY SINK DRAIN WAS PLUGGED. I STARTED DEFERRAL 3820P. AS I WAS ACCOMPLISHING THE Maintenance ITEMS TO COMPLETE THE DEFERRAL; ANOTHER Flight ATTENDANT RPTED THAT SHE THOUGHT THE WATER FAUCET WAS RUNNING TOO Longitude OR STICKING OPEN. AT THAT POINT I DECIDED TO Inoperative THE LAVATORY USING Minimum Equipment List 3830K; SO A MORE THOROUGH INSPECTION COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED. I CHKED FOR LEAKS. NONE FOUND. I THEN DETERMINED THE FAUCET FUNCTION WAS NORMAL AND I CLOSED AND LOCKED THE DOOR AND INSTALLED A 'DO NOT USE' PLACARD. I THEN LEFT THE Aircraft TO Check THE Minimum Equipment List TO SEE WHAT Maintenance ITEMS I HAD TO ACCOMPLISH TO COMPLY WITH THE Minimum Equipment List. WHEN I RETURNED; THE PLANE HAD BEEN DISPATCHED. I THEN CONTACTED THE LINE Maintenance Controller AND ADVISED HIM OF THE Situation. HE TOLD ME HE WOULD CONTACT THE CREW AND HAVE THE TRIP RETURN TO THE GATE. AFTER SEVERAL MINS I CALLED THE LINE Maintenance Controller FOR AN UPDATE AND HE SAID THE PLANE WAS AIRBORNE.
2,Equipment List,"Aircraft X ARRIVED AT GATE WITH (S,'S) Pilot WRITE-UP 'Captain'S BOOM MIKE BROKEN' AND (S,'S) Pilot ITEM #2 'OBSERVER'S HEADSET BROKEN.' THERE WERE 2 ADDITIONAL WRITE-UPS CONCERNING CABIN ITEMS WHICH I REPAIRED. THE Captain'S BOOM MIKE AND OBSERVER'S HEADSET PARTS WERE NOT IN STOCK HERE IN <Airport  (Domestic)>. SINCE THERE WAS AN Federal Aviation Administration JUMPSEAT RIDER; I TOLD THE Captain I COULD GO TO THE HANGAR AND RETRIEVE BOTH PARTS OFF A SPARE Aircraft. IT WAS DEP TIME NOW. THE Captain AND OBSERVER SAID THEY WOULD MAKE DO WITHOUT. I DEFERRED BOTH THE Captain'S BOOM MIKE AND OBSERVER'S HEADSET TO BE REPLACED WHEN PARTS AVAILABLE. THE Captain'S BOOM MIKE SHOULD HAVE BEEN Minimum Equipment List'ED UNDER 23-5104 AND THE OBSERVER'S HEADSET UNDER 25-1106A. IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME BOTH ITEMS NEEDED TO BE Minimum Equipment List'ED. Captain'S HEADSET/BOOM MIKE WAS A CLASS 'A' Minimum Equipment List. THIS WAS CLRLY AN OVERSIGHT ON MY PART. THE HUMAN FACTOR WAS TIME INVOLVED AND ME RUSHING TO GET THE Aircraft OUT ON TIME."
2,Equipment List,WE PICKED UP AN Aircraft FOR A Flight TO <Airport  (Domestic)>. IT HAD AN Minimum Equipment List 26-25-01 COND #1. THIS Minimum Equipment List REQUIRES THE CREW TO PERFORM A 'LAVATORY SMOKE DETECTOR Check.' WE COMPLIED; HOWEVER; WERE UNABLE TO FINISH THE Check AS WRITTEN IN THE Minimum Equipment List. WHEN WE GOT TO LINE ITEM E; 'SELECT System VERT(LY) Vertical STATUS' THERE IS NO OPTION FOR THAT OR LINE ITEM F. 'PRESS CONT AND OBSERVE LAVATORY SMOKE System VERT(LY) Vertical OK.' HOWEVER; PRIOR TO THAT AFTER COMPLETING LINE ITEM D; THERE IS A MESSAGE THAT STATES 'TEST OK.' WE CALLED LINE Maintenance AND HAD THEM PERFORM THE PROC; WITH SAME RESULTS; AND THEY SAID THE TEST WAS COMPLETE SINCE WE GOT 'TEST OK' IN LINE ITEM D. WE NEVER GOT TO LINE ITEM F; AND GOT 'LAVATORY SMOKE System VERT(LY) Vertical OK.' WE LEFT FOR <Airport  (Domestic)> AND HAD <Airport  (Domestic)> Maintenance PERFORM THE PROC; WITH SAME RESULTS. MAYBE NONE OF US EXECUTED THIS Minimum Equipment List CORRECTLY OR PERHAPS THIS PROC NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN SO SAFETY IS NOT COMPROMISED; Intermediate Fix THE TEST WAS NEVER FULLY COMPLETED. THAT WAY; OTHER CREWS AND THE COMPANY WON'T TAKE ANY FURTHER DELAYS FOR THIS Minimum Equipment List.
2,Equipment List,Minimum Equipment List'S IN POTENTIAL CONFLICT AND SUBJECT TO Interpretation  Medium Intensity Approach. I CHOSE TO OPERATE A Flight THAT HAD THE EPR PROBE HEAT OF ONE Engine Inoperative; THE RELATED EPR INDICATION Inoperative; AND THE AUTOTHROTTLE System VERT(LY) Vertical Inoperative. ATTACHED IS THE CHAIN OF EVENTS AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS ALONG WITH RECOMMENDATIONS TO CORRECT THE Situation AND RECURRENCE. THERE EXISTS A POSSIBLE CONFLICT IN Minimum Equipment List'S WHICH MAY LEAD TO EITHER 1) AN Aircraft GNDED WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY LEGAL AND SAFE TO DISPATCH; OR 2) AN Aircraft BEING DISPATCHED ILLEGALLY. I REVIEWED THE Aircraft READINESS DOCUMENT ONLINE THE DAY BEFORE MY Flight AND CALLED TO ALERT OPS THAT THIS Aircraft WILL NOT BE LEGAL TO FLY INTO FOREIGN AIRSPACE WITH THE PRESENT Minimum Equipment List'S. ARRIVED THE HUB TO FIND Aircraft HAD 6 Minimum Equipment List'S. ONE OF WHICH WAS INCORRECT; SHOWING THE INNER FUEL TANK PUMP FAULT 'LIGHT' AS Inoperative INSTEAD OF THE PUMP ITSELF. MY First Officer  Heading HDG(S) AND I REVIEWED THE OTHER Minimum Equipment List'S AND INTERPED THE EPR System VERT(LY) Vertical AS BEING LEGAL FOR DISPATCH PROVIDED THE ENTIRE Flight WAS CONDUCTED WITH ATS LEVER OFF. THUS; MORE RESTRICTIVE RATHER THAN IN CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER. Maintenance Control AND THE RAMP MECHS AGREED AS DID THE PREVIOUS CREWS WHO HAD FLOWN THE JET. ARRIVED Aircraft AND DISCUSSED THE PUMP LIGHT FAULT VERSUS PUMP FAULT WITH International Civil Aviation Mechanic AND HE AGREED TO CHANGE THE LOGBOOK. HOWEVER; IT REQUIRED A NEW Flight PLAN CALCULATED AT AN FL200 FUEL BURN AND AN ADDITIONAL 4400 LBS IN EACH INNER AS 'UNUSABLE.' I THEN ASKED THE FUELER TO STAY HERE AS WE WOULD NEED MORE FUEL. REVIEWING THE EPR Minimum Equipment List'S; Maintenance SAID THEY HAD BEEN WORKING ON Minimum Equipment List 77-10-01-B EPR #1 AND #2 INDICATIONS Inoperative. I ASKED THEM WHY IT WAS NOT SIGNED OFF SINCE THE INDICATORS WERE INDEED WORKING. THEY SAID THEY WERE NOT SURE Intermediate Fix IT MIGHT FAULT LATER ON INFLT DUE TO THE EPR PROBE HEAT FAULT AFFECTS THE ASSOCIATED EPR System VERT(LY) Vertical AND ITS GAUGE. I MADE MENTION OF THE NOTE FROM Maintenance Control THAT Intermediate Fix THEY WOULD FIX THE EPR PROBE HEAT FAULT; THAT THE OTHER PROBS WOULD GO AWAY. THEY ASSURED ME THAT THE JET WAS Flight READY AND LEGAL. ADDITIONALLY; SEVERAL OTHER CREWS AGREED AND HAD JUST FLOWN IT IN BRINGING IT TO ME. WE AGREED; AS A CREW; THAT IT WAS NOT A CONFLICTING Minimum Equipment List BUT RATHER ONE THAT REQUIRED A MORE CONSERVATIVE OP WITH MANUAL THROTTLE PROCS. ALL OTHER REQUIREMENTS WERE MET AND ACCOUNTED FOR IN PLANNING; AND THE TKOF; En Route; AND APCH PHASES OF Flight. BOTH MY First Officer  Heading HDG(S) AND I TREATED THE Minimum Equipment List'S IN THE MORE RESTRICTIVE MANNER AND THUS TOOK THE Aircraft WITHOUT THE USE OF THE ATS FOR THE DURATION OF THE Flight. ESPECIALLY; AS IT WAS NOT EXPRESSED IN THE MAIN BOX TO THE R OF THE Minimum Equipment List LABELED AS '(M)' '(O)' AS A REQUIREMENT TO HAVE THE ATS LEVER ON. BUT RATHER JUST DISCUSSED IN THE LATTER PARAGRAPH AS AN OPERATIONAL PROC TO TURN THE ATS LEVER ON; BUT RATHER TO USE MANUAL AUTOTHROTTLE PROCS AND THE AVAILABILITY TO USE PROFILE ABOVE 3000 Feet/Foot AFTER GEAR RETRACTION. RECOMMENDATIONS: Intermediate Fix THE Minimum Equipment List'S AE IN CONFLICT RENDERING THE Aircraft GNDED UNTIL REPAIRED; IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO ADD THE REQUIREMENT OF THE ATS LEVER 'ON' TO BE LISTED IN THE MAIN BOX OF REMARKS OR EXCEPTIONS. ALSO; IT COULD AND SHOULD INDICATE THAT NO OPERATIONAL RELIEF IS GIVEN FOR THE OTHER RELATED Minimum Equipment List'S. Intermediate Fix THESE Minimum Equipment List'S ARE NOT REALLY IN CONFLICT AND THE Aircraft IS CONSIDERED LEGAL TO DISPATCH; THEN THE NOTE TO TURN THE Automatic Terminal Information Service  LEVER 'ON' SHOULD BE AMENDED WITH WORDING SUCH AS 'Intermediate Fix AVAILABLE;' AND ADDITIONALLY THAT RELIEF IS OFFERED FOR THE RELATED System VERT(LY) Vertical. SAFETY WOULD BEST BE SERVED Intermediate Fix Maintenance Control HAS A 'RELATIONAL DATABASE' INCORPORATED INTO OUR COMPUTER GENERATED RELEASE AND Flight PLANNING System VERT(LY) Vertical; THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THE ISSUANCE OF A RELEASE/Flight PLAN WITH 'CONFLICTING' Minimum Equipment List'S AND; THEREFORE; NOT AIRWORTHY. THE System VERT(LY) Vertical THAT GENERATES BOTH THE Aircraft RELEASE AND FPR WOULD THUS SERVE AS A FINAL XCHK TO ENSURE THAT NO CONFLICTING Minimum Equipment List'S COULD BE PRINTED ON THE SAME FPR AND POTENTIALLY RELEASING AN Aircraft THAT IS INDEED NOT AIRWORTHY. OTHER FACTORS THAT RAISE WARNING SIGNS ARE THE UNNECESSARY INTERRUPTIONS TO LEGAL CREW REST; DEALING WITH AN EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF Minimum Equipment List'S; ESPECIALLY Intermediate Fix THEY ARE IN CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER AND THE RELIANCE ONE MIGHT PLACEON THE ADVICE OF Maintenance STAFF THAT IS SIGNING OFF ON THE Aircraft.
2,Equipment List,MECHS STRIKE; NEW Maintenance STAFF; BREAKDOWN OF OUR NORMAL PROCS TO TRACK AND MATCH Aircraft Minimum Equipment List'S WITH DISPATCH RELEASE DUE TO MISTAKE IN Aircraft LOGBOOK. A SEAT (9D) WAS Minimum Equipment List'ED Inoperative; BUT DUE TO ALL OF THE ABOVE; AND MY AND MY CREW'S OWN HONEST MISTAKE; WE OPERATED THIS Aircraft MOST OF THE DAY BEFORE I CAUGHT AND CORRECTED THE ERROR WITH OUR DISPATCH AND Maintenance Control.
2,Equipment List,"GOT A MESSAGE ON MCDU THAT SAID Flight Management Guidance Computer  1/2 Takeoff Gross Weight MISMATCH. HAD THE SAME MESSAGE SEVERAL WKS AGO ON ANOTHER Aircraft; AND WHEN I CALLED Maintenance ON THAT OCCASION I WAS DIRECTED TO RETURN TO THE GATE; WHERE A 3 (S,LY) Hour DELAY ENSUED WHICH DID NOT FIX THE PROB; AND I CANCELED THE Flight. SINCE THAT Flight I DISCOVERED THAT THE FIX FOR THAT ISSUE IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE; AND HAD BEEN PUBLISHED IN A COMPANY Publication; BUT WAS NOT MADE PART OF THE Minimum Equipment List PROC FOR A Flight QUANTITY INDICATOR CHANNEL Inoperative; WHICH CAUSES THE SUBSEQUENT MESSAGE DISPLAY. NOR WAS IT MADE AN ADDITIONAL PROC IN THE Flight MANUAL THAT I AM AWARE OF; BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER. THE ISSUE IS THAT IT IS NOT PART OF THE Minimum Equipment List DEFERRAL PROC AND HAS CAUSED Flight DELAYS/CANCELLATIONS THAT COST TIME AND MONEY. WHY THE PROC IS NOT INCORPORATED; I DON'T KNOW; BUT UPON GETTING THIS SIMILAR ISSUE I USED Captain'S Authority/Authorized TO SIMPLY INPUT MANUALLY THE Aircraft FUEL WT; WHICH GOT RID OF THE MESSAGE; AND WE TOOK OFF INSTEAD OF CALLING Maintenance; WHO MIGHT HAVE HAD ME RETURN TO THE GATE. I HAVE NOTIFIED Maintenance OF THIS OMISSION AND WILL ALSO CALL THE FLEET TECHNICAL SUPPORT PEOPLE."
2,Equipment List,"CONCERNING THE #2 REV UNLK LIGHT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF Minimum Equipment List; I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR EXPERIENCED THIS LIGHT COMING ON IN THE MANNER IN WHICH IT DID OR THE SEQUENCES OF EVENTS AFTER THE FACT. AND AS I EXPLAIN; THERE WAS MORE TO THIS EVENT THAT CAUSED ME TO DECLARE AN EMER; ROLL THE TRUCKS AND MAKE A SINGLE Engine LNDG WITH #2 Engine RETARDED WHICH GOES BEYOND THE REV UNLK LIGHT AND WHAT I ACTUALLY HAD TO DEAL WITH. HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED: I WAS VERY AWARE OF THE #2 REV BEING LOCKED OUT AND THE SCOPE OF THIS Minimum Equipment List. I HAVE HAD MANY EXPERIENCES WITH THIS PROB. ON TKOF WHILE CLBING OUT OF 1500 Feet/Foot THE REV UNLK LIGHT FOR #2 CAME ON. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS HAPPENING IN THIS MANNER BEFORE. THEN WE GOT THE MASTER CAUTION LIGHT WITH AURAL WARNING. AND THEN WE GOT THE Marker ACTION PAGE CALLING FOR #2 REVERSE UNLOCK WHICH IS THE RED BOX ITEM CALLING FOR RETARDING THE THROTTLE OR SHUTTING THE Engine DOWN. THIS IS A SERIOUS POSSIBILITY WITH QUESTIONABLE OUTCOME. THIS WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. ONLY THE REV UNLK IS NOTED TO BE ABLE TO ILLUMINATE UNDER THIS PARTICULAR Minimum Equipment List. I HAD NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS REAL OR NOT REAL SO I DECIDED TO FOLLOW Marker. WE RETARDED THE THROTTLE VIA Marker; DID ALL CHKLISTS AND LANDED WITH THE #2 Engine RETARDED AND SINGLE Engine. NO EVENT BUT HOT BRAKES TO THE GATE AND THIS WAS HANDLED APPROPRIATELY. THEN I WAS MET BY Maintenance AND THE ONLY THING THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ANY BEARING WAS THE REV UNLK LIGHT AND THE FACT THAT THE #2 REV WAS LOCKED OUT. AND ON ONLY 1 SIDE OF THE Engine DUE TO THE OTHER SIDE BEING STRIPPED AND UNABLE TO HOLD THE LOCK. THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED TO ADVISE MY CHIEF (S,'S) Pilot ABOUT THE INCIDENT. BUT I BASICALLY JUST ADVISED HIM OF THE EVENT AND NOT THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS JUST TO LET HIM KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I WAS DEALING WITH THE ISSUE MYSELF. MY First Officer  Heading HDG(S) EXPLAINED TO Maintenance THE ISSUE WITH THE Marker. WE WERE TOLD THAT THESE WARNINGS COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED AND THAT THE REV WAS LOCKED OUT REGARDLESS AND THAT THE OTHER WARNINGS HAD NO BEARING. WHILE I WAS CONVINCED AT THAT POINT I WAS NOT ANYTHING BUT CONFUSED DURING THE EVENT. AS IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME I ACCEPTED AND UNDERSTOOD THAT THE #2 REV WAS INDEED LOCKED OUT AND SAFE. I ENTERED A Maintenance LOG ITEM DEALING WITH THE BASIC ISSUE OF THE EVENT. AGAINST MY INSTINCT NOT TO IGNORE Marker I TOOK THE Aircraft TO ZZZ2 AND BACK. THE Aircraft DID THE SAME THING ON EACH TKOF AND I IGNORED AND DELETED THE Marker ALERT. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS I JUST COULD NOT ACCEPT. ON THE WAY BACK TO <Airport> I MADE A MORE DETAILED WRITE-UP AS Information TO Maintenance AND BRIEFED Maintenance UPON Arrival, Arrive. LOOKING AT THE EVENT AND THE Information I HAD; I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO FOLLOW Marker ON THE INITIAL EVENT. THERE ARE SOME THINGS HERE I AM BOTHERED WITH CONCERNING THIS. AND I AM NOT SO SURE I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE Aircraft AS IT WAS. I THINK REGARDLESS OF Minimum Equipment List Interpretation  Medium Intensity Approach OR CLARIFICATION FROM Maintenance THAT Marker SHOULD ALWAYS TAKE PRECEDENCE."
2,Equipment List,FAILED TO NOTICE 2 OPEN CABIN ITEMS IN AML. THE 2 PAGES WITH THE DISCREPANCIES WERE UNDER THE 'FLAP.' WHEN I RAISED THE FLAP LATER INFLT TO FILL OUT A NEW PAGE; I REALIZED THE ERROR. WE WERE LATE. OPS; DESPITE MY OBJECTIONS; TOOK OUR FIRST Aircraft FROM US WHEN WE WERE BOARDED AND READY TO GO AND SENT US TO A NEW PLANE AND GATE. 4 CALLS FOR CATERING; 2 CALLS FOR WATER/LAVATORY SVC; 2 Minimum Equipment List'S IN AML. I SIMPLY MISSED THE 2 OPEN ITEMS UNDER THE FLAP.
2,Equipment List,I APPLIED AN Minimum Equipment List 27-94-01 FOR A Selective Calling  Thunderstorm TSTM(S) #1 FAILURE. THERE WAS NO Maintenance ACTION REQUIRED FOR THIS Minimum Equipment List; HOWEVER; THERE MUST BE CIRCUIT BREAKERS PULLED IN THE OPS SECTION STEP 3. THIS MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED PRIOR TO EVERY DEP. WHILE READING THE Minimum Equipment List BOOK 27-94-01 CONDITION; I CONTACTED Maintenance Control AND STATED THE PROB. I MADE A NOTATION THAT I PULLED AND COLLARED 2 CIRCUIT BREAKERS PER THE OPS PROCS NOT UNDER THE Maintenance PROCS AND SENT A Maintenance MESSAGE STATING THIS AND REQUESTED IN THE Maintenance MESSAGE THAT THE LOG PAGE AND Minimum Equipment List BE REVIEWED. Minimum Equipment List 27-94-01 IS POORLY WRITTEN AND CONFUSING. REWRITE THE Minimum Equipment List TO INCLUDE ALL Maintenance ACTION REQUIRED. THERE IS A NOTE THAT IN EVENT OF A BAD Selective Calling  Thunderstorm TSTM(S) #1; Selective Calling  Thunderstorm TSTM(S) #1 AND Selective Calling  Thunderstorm TSTM(S) #3 CAN BE SWAPPED. MAYBE THIS SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT.
2,Equipment List,ARRIVED AT PLANE TO FIND Minimum Equipment List IGNITION System VERT(LY) Vertical 'A' Inoperative. UPON REVIEWING Minimum Equipment List; I DID NOT FIND THE DEFERRED NUMBER DECAL ADJACENT TO THE Engine MODE SELECTOR AS STATED IN THE SPECS NOTES; Maintenance; A. I THEN PERFORMED THAT STEP. LATER I FOUND THE DEFERRED NUMBER DECAL NEXT TO THE MANUAL START VALVE SWITCH. WHILE I UNDERSTAND THIS ERROR IS NOT LIFE THREATENING; IT IS INDICATIVE OF THE Maintenance PROCS I AM FINDING MORE AND MORE. TOO MANY OF THE DEFERRALS I RECEIVE HAVE SOME ERROR IN THEM. THIS INCORRECT STEP DID NOT CAUSE A PROB THIS TIME. WHAT ABOUT NEXT TIME?
2,Equipment List,During flight planning; Dispatch Computer System showed 1 Minimum Equipment List item on Aircraft X for flight <Airport  (Domestic)>-<Airport> which was 25-22-03B 'inflight entertainment.' I opened computer system to see what component of that system was inoperative so I could put the information in the remarks section of the release. I found not only Minimum Equipment List item 25-22 but also 38-10. I called Maintenance Control to see if 38-10 was active or not. Maintenance Control confirmed 38-10 was an active Minimum Equipment List on Aircraft X. I notified the training department of the discrepancy. I also wrote out the Minimum Equipment List 38-10 in the remarks section of the release; since it did not appear in computer system. I am unclear as to why there was/is a discrepancy between Maintenance Computer System and Dispatch Computer System at this time on this aircraft. Must ensure Maintenance Computer System and Dispatch Computer System share correctly the information concerning Minimum Equipment List's in order to safely plan and dispatch our aircraft/flights. Callback conversation with Reporter revealed the following information: Reporter stated their aircraft releases are generated under their Dispatch Computer System. But their Maintenance System Computer program does not automatically show all maintenance Minimum Equipment List's; or flight logs information in their Dispatch System. So the Dispatcher has to try and access their Maintenance Computer System to make sure all the Minimum Equipment List procedures are complied with prior to issuing a dispatch release.
2,Equipment List,After starting the second engine we received a boost pump left inner fault light. Followed Marker procedure to turn off the boost pump. Checked the Minimum Equipment List and found it was deferrable and a return to the gate was not required. I called Dispatch to connect me to Maintenance Control. After talking to the maintenance person; I wrote up the boost pump as inoperative and deferred the boost pump per Minimum Equipment List following instructions by maintenance. After completing the deferral I assumed I had completed everything and did not read the rest of the Minimum Equipment List. Because of this I did not get a new release from Dispatch and did not add additional fuel as required by the Minimum Equipment List. We took off and completed the 40 minute flight; landing with over 16;000 LBS of balanced fuel. Sitting in the blocks with both engines running; for over 15 minutes was bothersome; and probably contributed to my failure to review the Minimum Equipment List after talking to maintenance. In the future I will ensure every Minimum Equipment List procedure is complied with completely regardless of time.
2,Equipment List,After pushing back during engine start; IR3 started flashing; while stopped we tried several realignments to no avail.  The First Officer talked with Maintenance and I was texting Dispatch.  We agreed that we could proceed to our destination under the provisions of Minimum Equipment List 34-10-01 that I would only write up the discrepancy and destination maintenance would actually add the Minimum Equipment List to the airplane.  Enroute I read the Minimum Equipment List in great detail and it appears as though the ADIRU might have to have been inspected for P/N or serial number to determine if it was a go or no/go item.  It also says the flight deck crew can NOT Minimum Equipment List that IR3 inoperable.  We flew uneventfully to our destination with the IR3 in the off position. Being pushed back (a few minutes late at that) and in the alley; unable to speak with Maintenance Control I had to speed read the Minimum Equipment List while blocking a taxi way; seems the Dispatcher was OK (so I assume Maintenance was also) with us going just turn the IR3 off and let destination maintenance handle adding the Minimum Equipment List.  This whole procedure is so vague I would like to review the procedure and with this particular Minimum Equipment List to see if I did the right thing or not. Let us talk directly with Maintenance Control not going through the Dispatcher via TEXT!! Ridiculous in my opinion!
2,Equipment List,Minimum Equipment List 36-11 (engine bleed air sys) limited us to FL310 and restricted from flight into icing. At FL310 SAT was -36C icing is defined as visible moisture and temp >+10C or <-40C. Dispatch filed us with minimum fuel at M.70. We couldn't climb to colder air because of Minimum Equipment List; we couldn't descend to warmer air because of minimum fuel. I didn't know about the Minimum Equipment List in ops so I didn't check closely for cloud coverage on route; I also didn't know about the temps at altitude being so warm.  Once at aircraft I failed to think about icing because of our southern destination.Don't dispatch an aircraft with a bleed inop at any time because of altitude and temp limits for icing.
2,Equipment List,I was contacted by the outbound crew that the fire gloves in the cockpit were missing. The crew called Maintenance and was advised since the gloves are not in the Minimum Equipment List they grounded the plane and had to [be] replaced. The aircraft just came out of a heavy check and the gloves could have been removed then. The gloves are not part of the preliminary cockpit preparation checklist.
2,Equipment List,We were ready to go for an on-time. I realized we had an FMS 1 Legacy Flight Management Guidance Computer  installed and asked Dispatch to provide guidance on dispatch legality. FOM revision summary stated that all Airbuses had been converted to FMS2 and we found ourselves with a now obsolete piece of equipment. The Duty Chief Pilot responded quickly stating 'aircraft is legal for dispatch.' We were assigned an on-gate delay. I confirmed that it was a crew-based delay. I contacted Dispatch because I was concerned about a possible violation for accepting an aircraft that wasn't legal. We were somewhat rushed because the aircraft was late in arriving and we were full. It was a 'quick-turn' and I wanted to be certain we did not miss anything before dispatching. Many thanks to the Duty Chief Pilot and Fleet Technical Manager; for their quick response and clarification of this publication discrepancy. Details like this are probably 'no big deal' but since our FOM is now basically an electronic-based document online and the only contact we have with the paper-based volume is on the flight deck; we are reliant on the FOM summary. We are required to review the most current revision summary when it comes out; and I called the Duty Chief Pilot a week prior to let the crew desk know about the publication discrepancy. A bigger concern is that in the operations area; casual conversation suggests that some pilots are not in compliance with the requirement to review the document online. This will become one of our biggest challenges in the future. It is imperative that everyone at a minimum log on and document their compliance; since the online system captures log-ons and website navigation. If we want to remain paperless and 'virtual flight bag' then we have to maintain our currency. If we don't provide proof of compliance we may be asked to drag those flight bags around again. I'm certainly glad we are carrying less paper. I would hope everyone is logging on and checking their revision summaries like we are supposed to.
2,Equipment List,We arrived to find our next flight to ORD was on a ground delay due to low ceilings and deteriorating weather in Chicago. I called the Dispatcher to confirm the delay from the gate. He advised me of wheels up time. I discussed with him the fact that we had a long day already and would time out about 46 minutes after the proposed wheels up. This is where the outrageous pressure came from the Gate Supervisor; I informed her that we would be close to 'timing out' as a crew. I then returned to the aircraft and received the Automatic Communications Addressing & Reporting System message from Dispatch showing the wheels up time; I also printed her [Gate Supervisor] a copy. At about 2.5 hours from wheels up time I called scheduling and confirmed the information with him regarding the delay. I wanted to give him the 'heads up' that the possibility would exist that we may 'time out'. He said the 'powers that be' were talking it over. He suggested that I call back in a few minutes. He also mentioned someone from the station had called him. The Supervisor had apparently called him to reconfirm the information I had already given her. I had noticed that there were several mechanics in and out of the jetway. I went in to the aircraft to find three mechanics in the flight deck. I approached one and pleasantly asked if my aircraft was broke. He responded by saying; 'define broke'. I observed the mechanic who signed off the Minimum Equipment List on the cell phone in the cockpit. I returned to the aircraft about fifteen minutes later and noticed that he was still on the phone. I had grown suspicious after I had witnessed at least seven or eight mechanics come and go over a period of thirty to forty minutes. The mechanic in the cockpit had now been on the phone for a very long time. I assumed he was talking to Maintenance Control. Meanwhile; I thought we could begin boarding at XA55 and push at XB25. This would give us plenty of time to taxi and takeoff. Five minutes before boarding the Gate Supervisor grew very impatient and began interrupting me while I was explaining the situation to the Assistant Chief Pilot. The mechanics in the cockpit and I told her we would let her know when it was reasonable for her to begin the boarding process. I phoned scheduling and he informed me they were going 'to roll the dice' and hope for a XC07 or earlier departure. The Gate Supervisor continued to interrupt us even after she was told there was no 'new information' regarding the amount of time the mechanics would require to resolve the situation. This was very annoying and disruptive. After a long period of time the mechanic got off the cell phone and informed me he was putting Minimum Equipment List 28-40-06 condition L and N inner and outer fuel gage inoperative. The problem was that the Minimum Equipment List stated '2 installed and 1 required'. Both channels in the right wing outer and right wing inner were inoperative also causing the FOB (Fuel On Board) to be inoperative. I looked at the Minimum Equipment List. This is when it crossed my mind that the lengthy conversation was how to GET AROUND all the malfunctions in the fuel system. Now the gate agent was back while I was working to understand what the mechanics have tried to do. I tried to explain to the mechanic that this Minimum Equipment List requires one of the systems to be working and they were not. With a long day behind us; and a three hour flight ahead of us with an alternate; I needed to know how much fuel was on board. The mechanic who added the Minimum Equipment List suggested I call my Chief Pilot. I called the chief pilot office at XB05 and asked if I could speak to someone regarding an airbus issue. I was on hold when; of course; comes my favorite Gate Supervisor to get her five minute update. I tried to explain that I had called Dispatch and tried to get another aircraft at XA45 but; was informed there weren't any. She did not accept that information gently and demanded that she 'had to know'. I spoke with the Assistant Chief Pilot and he said he would be right over. I showed him the Minimum Equipment List. We agreed this is a bigger problem than one channel out.The entire fuel system was down. He called the Airbus Fleet Manager. He agreed this was not a valid Minimum Equipment List. I called my Dispatcher to advise him of the situation. We called Scheduling and they released us.The Minimum Equipment List requires one of the systems to be working. If a mechanic cannot explain the Minimum Equipment List or I am not comfortable with the Minimum Equipment List and the way it reads; being the Captain in command of the aircraft; I should not be suggested to call the Chief Pilot. There was no safe way to get around this serious malfunction. The problem I have noticed that has occurred in 2010 is that too much pressure is put on Maintenance to get the aircraft off the gate. It appears this group will do anything to get an Minimum Equipment List added even if it is not correct. In regard to safety; this culture is extremely dangerous. If the Captain of the aircraft says 'no'....that means 'no'. The repetitive interruption from gate agents and Gate Supervisors only adds to the length of a delay.
2,Equipment List,Lately my Air Carrier Management has been increasingly questioning Captain's decisions on aircraft refusals. If one were to refuse an aircraft for an inoperable window heat; I would venture that a call would be received by a Flight Manager questioning the refusal. After seeing the effect of what this one minor 'Minimum Equipment List' item had yesterday; it opened my eyes even further to the necessity of considering all possibilities. Upon arrival the Captain's forward window completely fogged over to the point that one could not see clearly out of it. Even with using the windshield wiper the window did not clear properly. Taxiing to the gate was even more interesting as the fogging continued. The Captain had to look out his side window to see properly. I have photos of what the event looked liked once we were on the ground. I will try to forward the photos to the appropriate members. In addition to the Captain's window heat being inoperative; this aircraft also had an aft cargo door Minimum Equipment List'ed showing open on Marker while it was closed; right side high pressure valve locked in the open position; Class Sequenced Flashers (Cat  Config) Flight CTRL message; and a few cabin items. Oh; and the plane went through a major maintenance base at least two times yesterday. The Federal Aviation Administration deemed an inoperative window heat system as a Minimum Equipment List-able item. I guessed they did not consider the effect of warm; humid air has on a cold soaked windshield. With all this going on once we landed; we both looked at each other and wondered if we had a clearance to land. Tower had not said anything to us but there still is a question in my mind.
2,Equipment List,This crew flew duty period 1 of our 4 day trip uneventfully from the U.S. to the Caribbean which was then scheduled to receive a 'reduced rest' period (R3) in the Caribbean due to being scheduled for 9:37 flight time in a 24 hour period. The next morning; duty period 2; when arriving at the aircraft in the Caribbean; preflight inspection revealed the First Officers 'Nav Display Unit' (NDU 2) was blank; and would not display any information....it was just blank. I called Maintenance Control to discuss the item and we both agreed this item could be covered as an Minimum Equipment List item; allowing the aircraft to continue to our destination (a Company Maintenance Station.) After 20 minutes of discussion on a cell phone with Maintenance Control about the correct write up procedure; pilot corrective action remarks; placarding procedures and logbook sign offs; we realized that our onboard aircraft Minimum Equipment List book had been revised and that I did not have the current Minimum Equipment List description for this particular discrepancy. Our Minimum Equipment List issue date was from 2009; and Maintenance Control had an updated 2010 version which I needed a copy of; since some of the restrictions had changed. We had completed the entire logbook entry process with 15-20 still remaining to departure time; however our departure was delayed almost 40 minutes while we waited for our operations in the Caribbean to receive a fax with the current Minimum Equipment List revision covering the discrepancy. We departed the Caribbean approximately 40 minutes late in good Visual Meteorological Conditions conditions; and remained in marginal Visual Flight Rules to Visual Flight Rules-on-top conditions for the entire flight to the Company Maintenance Station.We were scheduled to continue with this same aircraft on from the Company Maintenance Station on; and then another leg. Knowing this; when approaching the Company Maintenance Station from the Caribbean and within Automatic Communications Addressing & Reporting System range; we reminded the Company Maintenance Station that we would be looking to have the NDU 2 replaced there. Ten minutes prior to landing; we again radioed the station to remind them we had an item we wanted fixed there. After landing; the crew cleared customs; and returned to our aircraft (which the agent was anxious to board for the next flight) only to find out that Maintenance had visited the aircraft; performed a brief and required 'daily check' on the aircraft; and had converted the pilot-Minimum Equipment List for the NDU 2 into a regular maintenance Minimum Equipment List for the NDU 2. Clearly; the intention was to minimize delay; and have the crew continue to fly with an inoperative NDU 2; in the interest of 'keeping on schedule.'My original First Officer was replaced due to illness; and I met the replacement First Officer; who informed me he was still 'new' on the aircraft. Although he did have over 100 hours in type he said he was still 'getting used' to the aircraft. With this knowledge and after noting a severe weather advisory for thunderstorms had been issued for the destination area and along the route to there; I determined it was not in the interest of safety to continue there and then on with a 'new' First Officer and an inoperative NDU 2 screen; effectively cutting in half our ability to see and navigate around any severe weather; and safely navigate our route. After some discussion with Maintenance I explained I would not take the aircraft in its degraded state; and expressed frustration in that they had nearly 5 hours notice of the aircraft's condition upon arrival; and that they knew the crew had to clear customs before continuing on allowing additional time for maintenance to be performed; and that the scheduled turnaround time for these flights was 1:37 to begin with; plenty of time to replace a display unit screen. The mechanic who performed the daily check was somewhat perplexed as well; since he stated to me that the replacement display unit had been sent to the aircraft; was available and waiting for replacement; yet Maintenance Control had said it would now take 'too long' to replace the screen; and was just goingto keep the item on Minimum Equipment List and send us on our way. Realizing I would not accept the aircraft with that Minimum Equipment List for the next two legs due to the proximity and severity of weather along the route; Maintenance then put an estimated time of departure delay of approximately and hour and a half. Shortly afterward; Dispatch and Maintenance decided to swap aircraft and issue us another aircraft for our next flight. As we were preflighting the new aircraft; we were advised that destination traffic now had a ground stop due to severe weather; and we were issued a next update time of approximately 1:30. After checking again about 40 minutes later; we heard clearance issuing re-routes for two other flights to our destination; so we inquired about a re-route for us; and were ultimately issued a different routing due to weather. Once airborne and while enroute; we were issue no less than 4 additional re-routes; still due to severe weather. Thankfully; with the high task loading for both pilots of accurately inputting new routes into the Flight Management Guidance Computer  while still navigating around multiple thunderstorm systems; we did NOT accept an aircraft with only one operable Nav Display Unit. Both pilots were kept very busy inputting and verifying new route segments while safely avoiding dangerous weather. The flight landed uneventfully. The following flight was again task saturated; due to airborne re-routes and deviations around the same massive storm systems; and successfully landed in our final destination.Our company has gone too far in their attempts to stay 'on time.' The corporate philosophy has shifted much too far in favor of keeping schedule at minimum cost; and much too far away from maintaining adequate staff; parts; and qualified mechanics; pilots; and customer service agents on staff to properly run the airline. The agents are far too heavily task saturated when everything is running 'smoothly;' and they become woefully inadequate for our customer's needs when there is even the slightest disruption to a perfect operation. One agent to check in passengers; board an aircraft; answer questions and accommodate seat change requests; process frequent flier mileage updates and wheelchair requests; etc. is sadly inadequate. In addition; every agent is intimidated about having any flight leave the gate even a minute late; is constantly answering to their supervisors as to why they were not 'on time' (which does not necessarily mean departing the gate on schedule; but rather 5-10 minutes early!) The Maintenance Department has been outsourced at all but a handful of stations which we serve. This outsourcing has allowed the company to maintain virtually NO spare parts at an overwhelming majority of our stations served; other then a steady stream of Minimum Equipment List stickers for use to keep the airplanes flying. Even at our largest of Maintenance Stations there are so few mechanics on staff that they are unable to complete most line repairs due to the (company perceived) delay it will cause the outgoing flight. In other words; we would rather put a 'band-aid' and an Minimum Equipment List sticker and send the aircraft out than fix it properly and promptly. The problem with this philosophy is it is contradictory to the preamble governing our Minimum Equipment List authority. As with my case in point as stated above; the INTENT of the Minimum Equipment List system is to (according to the preamble) 'allow the aircraft to be safely flown to a station where repairs may be made.' This does NOT mean carrying an item on Minimum Equipment List through maintenance hubs for 3; 4; or 5 days in order to 'trouble shoot' or keep the airline on schedule. The Preamble also states that it is important to note the 'importance of accomplishing repairs at the earliest opportunity.'The company has sadly warped the intent by creating a deliberate shortage of parts supplies; and then claiming the required repairs are unable to be made due to 'parts availability.' I believe this is NOT a valid interpretation of the Minimum Equipment List preamble intent....the intent is to allow the safe continuation of the aircraft to the first available maintenance station CAPABLE of performing the repair; whether that be at a Company Maintenance Station or a Contract Maintenance Station; but one which has a qualified mechanic and the required expertise and equipment capable of conducting the repair. Parts availability is a company issue; and the company's obligation is to get the part to the aircraft at a station where 'repairs MAY be made.' Additionally; the pilot force has been subjected to increasing pressure by phone calls from Chief Pilots 'urging' them to 'use good judgment;' or to 'help' them make their decision about taking an aircraft which the pilot may feel is not in proper condition for continued operation. This is all very indicative of an extremely poor safety culture; a major distrust between the pilot force and the 'management pilots;' and increased hostility between the maintenance; operations; in-flight; and customer service departments ALL due to managements increased pressure to provide more service with fewer people; parts; and time. EVERY employee (short of middle to upper management) is feeling intimidated; pressured; coerced; and harassed by the pressures exerted from above; while each and every employee group has taken repeated pay cuts; reduced vacation and sick time; while shouldering mandatory additional overtime; extra duties and responsibilities.This company simply requires more employees to provide the level of service our costumes deserve; and to allow our employees to recover and recuperate from the increased demands placed on them through several bankruptcies and ever more tyrannical management personalities.
2,Equipment List,"This concerns Minimum Equipment List 31-63-01 condition 'D' versus condition 'B.' During flight from <Airport  (Domestic)> to <Airport>; the Status Display Unit (SDU) aka: lower Marker display unit was written up as 'too dim in flight' and notice was sent to <Airport> Maintenance via Automatic Communications Addressing & Reporting System. After parking at gate; two Maintenance personnel came to the cockpit with checklist in hand and began checking out the SDU. They pointed out that the screen brightened with direct light from a flashlight and I said that it wasn't bright enough during flight with direct sunlight or even with overcast skies. They stated that there were no displays available in <Airport> and I replied that an Minimum Equipment List for that display would be fine.I departed the aircraft to get lunch and upon returning found that the First Officer's Navigation Display (ND) and the SDU had been switched with each other; thus the Minimum Equipment List would now be for the ND (condition B) not the SDU (condition D)! The First Officer would now have an inoperable Navigate, Navigation  (S,ING) display; therefore no route; altitude constraints; en route airport/VOR positions; and very importantly; no radar display available. On the other hand; the SDU; used only occasionally; would be fine. I asked why they switched the two displays and they explained that the ND Minimum Equipment List was easier to apply than the SDU Minimum Equipment List. So; for the sake of a few minutes of Minimum Equipment List checklist items (one and one half pages) required for the SDU Minimum Equipment List; they were willing to sacrifice a safety of flight item; the ND (which only required four or five checklist items). The operational 'O' required checklist items was fairly long also; being about 3/4's of a page.I requested the displays be returned to their original positions and the SDU be Minimum Equipment List'ed. I was told to talk with Maintenance Controller X and I called him from the [passenger] loading bridge. He insisted that it was easier to Minimum Equipment List the ND; but after mentioning my safety of flight concerns of not having the Navigate, Navigation  (S,ING) display and after a long pause; he said to switch them back. This was accomplished with the proper Minimum Equipment List placed on the SDU. After some difficulty proceeding through the SDU Minimum Equipment List checklist; the Maintenance personnel went inside and retrieved an updated revision to this Minimum Equipment List; which simplified their procedures quite a bit (about a half-page long). We were also told that our next destination; ZZZ2; had a new display to replace the Minimum Equipment List'ed SDU and they did so.Maintenance Control wanted to take the easy/quickest way out with no regard for the safest way to resolve the problem of a 'lower Marker (SDU) too dim in flight' write up. This was passed down from Maintenance Control; no less.Maintenance should always have the latest Minimum Equipment List revisions available. If they had; they would have been able to place the Minimum Equipment List much more quickly on the SDU and therefore not compromise the safety of our flight by dispatching with only one Navigate, Navigation  (S,ING) display. Safety is always first!"
2,Equipment List,"On climb-out; aircraft was vectored off the Standard Instrument Departure and given a 350 heading and a climb to FL350. The heading and altitude were set in the FCU and verified on the Flight Mode Annunciator by the Captain and First Officer. This heading closely paralleled the Standard Instrument Departure. Later; during the climb; it was noted that the air conditioning system was sending below freezing air to the cabin. As the Captain worked the problem; and the new First Officer helped and accomplished his other duties; the aircraft somehow reverted to the navigation mode. This resulted in a turn to the right. The crew and Air Traffic Control noticed the turn at about 010 degrees and an immediate correction was made. This aircraft was dispatched with two Minimum Equipment List's on the air conditioning system. Somehow the combination made temperature control problematic and the distraction contributed to the delayed recognition of the turn. While I am still not sure why the aircraft reverted to the Navigate, Navigation  (S,ING) mode; it should have been recognized sooner. I needed to remember the cardinal rule of one pilot flying the aircraft exclusively and the other working the problem. Secondarily; the compound Minimum Equipment List's led to a distraction during a busy phase of flight. This contributed to the delayed recognition. These Minimum Equipment List's had existed for three and seven days each and the aircraft had transited Maintenance stations multiple times. Although legal; Minimum Equipment List's that could cause distractions should be repaired in a timelier manner."
2,Equipment List,Inbound flight made a writeup that Public Address and flight attendant call chimes were inaudible in the forward galley area.  Maintenance came on and deferred the chimes.  Minimum Equipment List stated Public Address must operate normally.  They contended that it did and it was only a speaker problem.  I contended that the speaker was part of the system.  They disagreed.  Maintenance Control was contacted and stated that they thought that the Public Address did work normally because it could be heard in the back.  They told me to write the Public Address up and I did.  The new Minimum Equipment List stated that the call chimes had to work normally.  Up to this writing; nothing mechanically has been done.   Per conversation with Maintenance Control and Dispatch; Maintenance Control contends that per Minimum Equipment List that I can use the interphone to take this plane if I establish chime or Public Address contact with the aft flt attendants who will call the forward flt attendant; (I don't know how) who will then call me.  I had to refuse the aircraft because none of this appears to comply with the intent of the Minimum Equipment List to me.
2,Equipment List,Inbound flight logged 2 items- System VERT(LY) Vertical 1 FAULT DISPLAYED ON UPPER Marker-BRAKES and AUTOBRAKE FAULT DISPLAYED ON UPPER Marker SCREEN-BRAKES. Maintenance deferred the first Marker with Minimum Equipment List 32-42-03 BSCU 1 inoperative. That deferral makes a reference to the autobrake panel mode lights being inoperative and has a note FOR BSCU CHANNEL/SYSTEM 1 INOPERATIVE REFER TO Minimum Equipment List FOR Automatic/BRK PANEL MODE LIGHTS DEFERRAL. Maintenance took that reference and used it to defer the second Marker listed above (Minimum Equipment List 32-42-04). In my review of the Minimum Equipment List; once on board; I did not question the linking of the second Marker to the first Marker Minimum Equipment List; guidance that was made by Maintenance. I ASSUMED that Maintenance had specific guidance that the second Marker was a result of the loss of BSCU 1 and the autobrake panel lights; nothing more complex that had to be evaluated for compound failures. We complied with all Minimum Equipment List restrictions prior to departure to include verifying that the autobrakes were armed on the wheels SD page. Checking recall prior to departure only brought up the first Marker. No autobrake Marker or status messages were present. This furthered my belief that the maintenance issues had been addressed correctly. Taxi; takeoff and initial climb were normal. Nearing FL350 we received the same autobrake fault Marker received by the first crew. We complied with the Irregular Procedure. We determined that we had lost normal brakes but did have antiskid. Further review of the Flight Manual to include the system resets section made it apparent to me that the autobrakes Marker; while obviously related to the brake system fault Marker; was not linked to it as a secondary failure due to the lights failure. We had two separate failures; as did the inbound flight that should have been treated as such. The maintenance dispatch was improper/illegal. Trust but VERIFY everything! Careful verification of maintenance actions could have prevented this.
2,Equipment List,I dispatched a flight from MMUN. This aircraft had Minimum Equipment List 25-61-01A which is a portable ELT. This particular Minimum Equipment List states 'May be inoperative provided no Extended Overwater operations are conducted.' Under Operation Procedures for the Minimum Equipment List; it further states 'Aircraft may NOT conduct extended overwater operations; however it may be eligible for limited overwater operations. In order to comply with this Minimum Equipment List; the flight must be routed in a way so it does not exceed 30 minutes flying time in still air with one engine inoperative; or 162 Nautical Mile from the nearest  shoreline; whichever is less. I dispatched the flight. This route did not comply with the Minimum Equipment List and I; nor the flight crew; caught this error. I made the assumption that the aircraft was allowed to fly the standard route based on the fact that it had already flown with that Minimum Equipment List; and after I had spoken with the Safety Officer; confirming that it only restricted Extended Range Twin Operations operations. I did reference the Minimum Equipment List manual; but failed to read the Operations Procedures which outlines the restrictions.If it is a possibility with dispatch software; a safeguard that would prevent a flight plan from calculating if it was in violation of an Minimum Equipment List restriction would prevent this from happening in the future (much like how a flight plan will not calculate if you attempt to plan a non-overwater A/C on an overwater route). I have reason to believe that numerous people missed this restriction due to the fact that we are not Extended Range Twin Operations qualified. As a result; assumptions are made that there are no Operations Procedures; that it does not pertain to us; and they then fail to continue reading past the Minimum Equipment List to see if any action needs to be taken. Perhaps a notification can be incorporated into dispatch monitor when running a flight plan with this or similar MELs.  For example; a pack Minimum Equipment List will notify you that you must remain at a certain flight level and that there is a fuel penalty. These notifications appear on the flight summary page before taking you to the flight plan.  The note could say something along the lines of; 'Flight is restricted to limited overwater operations due Minimum Equipment List 25-61-01A.' Also for the Dispatch group; reiterate the importance of reading an Minimum Equipment List in it's entirety via training or an Ops Memo.
2,Equipment List,I was assigned to work an Minimum Equipment List on an A320 aircraft and I was supposed to change the High Pressure (HP) 10th stage bleed valve closure solenoid (4029ks). Instead I changed the HP 10th stage solenoid (4023ks); not realizing I changed the wrong solenoid because the terminology confused me. See Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) figures [drawings] in Chapters 75-23-53 and Troubleshooting Manual (TSM) 36-11-00. I was working at night; outside on Pad-5 on my third night. At the same time; I was assisting a Mechanic working a 2.5 bleed actuator on the opposite motor and may have been distracted. I had changed the wrong part and re-deferred the Minimum Equipment List. Two nights later; another Mechanic was assigned the same job to fix the Minimum Equipment List; but could not locate the part in stock that I had installed incorrectly. After researching; that Mechanic found the part installed in the incorrect position. Distraction and confusion between AMM figures in 75-32-53 and TSM 36-11-00; the Minimum Equipment List was cleared during the second visit.
2,Equipment List,Early morning; received a gate call for [Air Conditioning] Pack Regulator fault. Tried to perform an Operational Check to try to reset the system; but could not get the system to reset. Contacted Maintenance Control and both of us agreed to place Pack-1 on Minimum Equipment List 21-51-01C for a Pack Regulator fault. We both missed one step of the Minimum Equipment List where it requires to also apply Minimum Equipment List 21-52-01D. The aircraft flew one flight before Minimum Equipment List 21-52-01D was applied. Lack of Communication between Myself and Maintenance Controller. We both agreed on which Minimum Equipment List to apply but failed to apply second Minimum Equipment List called for. This event happened at the end of my shift; so fatigue may have also been a factor. This event could have been prevented by being more familiar with Minimum Equipment List procedures and reviewing the Minimum Equipment List once applied.
2,Equipment List,I; Maintenance Controller; placed an Minimum Equipment List on an A321 aircraft that was in <Airport>; but our computer systems were down and could not access the full Minimum Equipment List menu due to an outage from our communications provider and was not aware the Flight Warning Computer (FWC-1) could not be MELed.  I did not have our Air Carrier's full Minimum Equipment List procedure to use. [Recommend] having a better back up [procedure] for computer failures.
2,Equipment List,Departed with an Minimum Equipment List'd Pack Flow Sensor. All Minimum Equipment List procedures were complied with. This included leaving the Hot Air p.b. switch in the OFF position. About 10 minutes after takeoff; Flight Attendant (F/A) called to say that cabin was cold. I adjusted the cabin temp selectors to a warmer position. As I monitored the cabin temp getting colder instead of warmer; I selected increasing amounts of warm temperature with no effect on the cabin temperature. A F/A called again to say the cabin was REALLY cold. By now we were level at FL310. The observed temperatures were 35 degrees F air going into the cabin with the cabin temp at 60 F and decreasing with all cockpit and cabin temp selectors selected to full hot. I initiated a call to dispatch and was patched through to maintenance to see if they had any ideas on how to fix our problem. I was told that they had nothing and that this particular Minimum Equipment List had been a problem before. In fact he added that this Minimum Equipment List should instead be an aircraft refusal. Armed with this knowledge I advised dispatcher that we would not be able to continue to [destination.] He suggested (two airports ahead of us). By now cabin temp was 54 F. [and his closest option] was still 450 miles away. I advised dispatch that my preference was for <Airport  (Domestic)>; 120 miles directly south. Dispatch said [it was] my call and; at that time; the phone patch was lost. My First Officer (F/O) got the weather for <Airport> and <Airport  (Domestic)>. <Airport  (Domestic)> weather was good but <Airport> visibility at a mile and a half. With increasing cold and discomfort on the aircraft (by now the cockpit was uncomfortably cold); I decided safest course of action was diversion to <Airport  (Domestic)> with overweight landing. Diversion was coordinated with dispatch over Automatic Communications Addressing & Reporting System and then requested with Air Traffic Control. Cabin was prepped for normal arrival. As we approached <Airport  (Domestic)>; I received message from dispatch that gate would not be available for some time. I decided to enter holding to take a little extra time to review the overweight landing procedure in the North N Quick Reference Handbook. I also called ops via Very High Frequency and found out that we had both an open gate and a mechanic standing by. With good weather; light winds; and a [very long] runway; I was confident that the overweight landing was the safest course of action. Out of extreme caution I had the F/O [advised Air Traffic Control] and asked to have the equipment standing by. We made a very uneventful landing at 149400 pounds; touching down at less than 200 Feet Per Minute. The taxi to the gate was normal. I will not take an airplane again with this Minimum Equipment List unless the flight is under an hour and then only in the summer.
2,Equipment List,During preflight; the first officer noticed on the Hydraulic Marker page that the line extending up from the blue pump was green instead of amber as it should be with no Blue System pressure. The System was otherwise indicating no pressure. We entered the discrepancy in the log book and called maintenance. The maintenance technicians were instructed by Maintenance Control to apply Minimum Equipment List 29-30-03F; Marker Hydraulic Page Indications; System Pressure.  I was uncomfortable with the validity of this Minimum Equipment List as our Flight manual indicates that system pressure is depicted by the three numerical values at the top of the Marker page only. I brought this up to the maintenance technicians who were applying the Minimum Equipment List and they said they were doing what Maintenance Control had instructed them to do and assured me that that green line was; indeed; a pressure indication. I objected and asked them to provide some form of documentation to show that this fell under the Minimum Equipment List they were applying. Maintenance Control was not willing to provide any documentation; but the technicians provided some documentation that this was a pressure indication.... Still not comfortable; I tried to call scheduling to get a number to talk to a chief pilot but sat on hold for quite some time. I also tried to look up some reference which would give me an idea of whether this Minimum Equipment List was appropriate. As we no longer have any kind of a Systems book other than the A320 training manual; which is too vague for this purpose; I was unsuccessful in that endeavor. At this point; I had nothing other than a vague recollection from my original systems training in 1996 that this was different from a system pressure; and the people whose job and responsibility it is to determine what is an appropriate Minimum Equipment List all assured me that it was correct. At this point we looked again at the Marker Hydraulic page and noticed the line had turned amber (normal). At that point; since the problem was clearly documented the fault no longer existed and we couldn't find anything excluding this fault from the Minimum Equipment List; we decided to depart.After we departed; I was still uncomfortable; so I looked again at the Minimum Equipment List for more definitive information. The one thing that I noticed is that for this Minimum Equipment List; it states that there are three installed and one may be inoperative. Because there are three numerical pressure indications at the top of the Marker page; I feel this casts some doubt on the appropriateness of this Minimum Equipment List for this particular failure.The main reason the event occurred is that the Minimum Equipment List and Flight manuals are not specific enough; in my humble opinion to determine if this is an appropriate Minimum Equipment List for the system failure being addressed. Also; I have been told things by local maintenance in the past that turned out to be not correct. I can't name a case where Maintenance Control was incorrect; but after a few experiences; I don't trust maintenance to tell me what I can and cannot fly with without clear documentation. In order to be more sure of our actions; and not delay flights with maintenance issues; we need someone we can easily and quickly contact during all operating hours; whom we trust; to discuss such issues. This is a complicated airplane and history has shown me that maintenance is not that someone.  When writing an Minimum Equipment List; it must be impossible to think of all the scenarios which may occur like this. That is; cases where it is unclear if an Minimum Equipment List is appropriate. It would be helpful in this case if a note were added to the Minimum Equipment List including or excluding the green line in question. It would also be helpful if the Flight manual labeled this green line. I was unable to find a reference anywhere describing exactly what it is....Please understand; that like most pilots at this airline; I want to operate a safe aircraft and I want to operate on time. I find ambiguity in the operation to be my large impediment to attaining this goal.
2,Equipment List,This flight is this inbound flight of an out and back trip. The Minimum Equipment List 29-24-01 was still in effect during this flight and as on the previous leg I could not complete a preflight alternate brake check accumulator check or confirm good pressure with the parking brake set. The same agencies were contacted and consulted with again and the information given to me was that the MX Check done by MX covered for my checks. No reference or procedure for crew in Minimum Equipment List 29-24-01. As before I made sure chocks and tug in place to back up parking brake until an engine was started. Incomplete Minimum Equipment List procedures led the crew to seek info and advice from other sources.
2,Equipment List,During preflight; First Officer found an approximate 3-4 ft circumference area of oil on the ground around right main landing gear. Oil also filled cement joint crack for 5-6 ft. Found substance leaking from main landing gear actuator at approximately 1 drip per second. Reported to mx and entered discrepancy into logbook. Maintenance pressurized hydraulic system. Took [the logbook] and left.Maintenance applied Minimum Equipment List to gear actuator. After reviewing; Minimum Equipment List; I re-inspected the landing gear drip. Based on my second inspection of the gear and drip; I felt the Minimum Equipment List was inappropriate to the condition of the aircraft. Specifically; the drip per minute appeared to be in excess of the amount allowed by the Minimum Equipment List. The drip rate along with the amount of fluid on the ground gave me cause for concern. The Maintenance person who returned the [logbook] told me that [maintenance control] had made the decision on the Minimum Equipment List not the crew working on the aircraft and that they did not have part to fix the aircraft. The part was in [another airport] and the aircraft was scheduled to have the part replaced when it reached [the other airport] at the end of the day. After hearing this and given; our concerns I refused the aircraft.Maintenance called [Chief Pilot]; who also inspected the aircraft and reviewed the situation with both crewmembers.
2,Equipment List,I arrived for my 4th of 4 days; XA:20 show to operate me scheduled flight. The plane had 4 MELs to begin with. The two I'll focus on are 27-XX-XX-Y. After reviewing the Minimum Equipment List; there were several people questioning whether we could even apply this specific Minimum Equipment List. The Modification (MOD) list needed to be referenced and after that was complete it came down to the word 'OR' as the aircraft had one MOD installed but not the other. After 40 minutes of discussion; the TLR was modified. If you also include the passenger medical issue requiring a paramedic sign off; you can see it was a very busy morning already. After successful engine start; we performed the first control check (not required by the Minimum Equipment List) and observed only 'pair 3' locked out. Per the sign off; the aircraft needed both sets disabled. We needed to leave the ramp for company to push. With all the General Aviation traffic the only place to go was the end of the runway. After a quick review of the Minimum Equipment List; for either a paperwork swap to one pair inoperative or for two pair inoperative; we needed a Mechanic (MX). We verified this with Maintenance Control; :25 later (can't remember exactly) we parked at the gate. Just to take a second here ... The system was 'MELed' on the 4th and flew. We're the spoilers correctly disconnected? If so; did they trouble shoot overnight and not re-comply? These two items I don't have the information for but I do know for a fact I was given the plane with a non-compliant Minimum Equipment List procedure. The flight Ops assistant met us and inquired about the situation. I gave him a quick airbus systems dissertation on why we were back at the gate. MX quickly met us and took the logbook to examine the work and why we weren't in compliance. Within: 10 or so they were back and another: 03 the new procedure was apparently completed. 'Wow I thought that was quick'. Looking at the Flight Control (F/Control) page we now had 3/4 spoilers 'X-ed' out. Even though it did not call for the next step; I insisted we do a control check prior to push. They cleared the outside and the 'visible cockpit indications' showed correct deflections. We buttoned up and pushed back; check Automatic Information System (AIS) for times. Maybe an hour late? This is the SECOND TIME we were apparently Minimum Equipment List compliant. I can't speak for what the other crew saw but as for us; everything we saw on the instruments and paperwork said we were compliant. My First Officer (First Officer  Heading HDG(S)) was flying the first leg. It was windy for our departure; rotation was normal but the coordination and turning were sloppy. Probably due to both turbulence and 1/2 of the roll spoilers gone. As we accelerated thru 12;000' and the ride calmed down thru the upper teens; we started to notice the Left Hand (LH) wing started to indicate a slight wing down indication on the Primary Flight Display (PFD). As we climbed further and transitioned to Mach; the indication continued. We changed to the #1 DFGC; at first there appeared to be some improvement but that later mimicked #2. We disconnected the autopilot and manually trimmed the plane out with the rudder. We couldn't fully right the wings. Once we leveled at FL360; we reengaged #2 and watched the PFD/F/Control indications. 2-3deg LH turn on the PFD; LH AIL outside the cruise ticks; RH AIL normal. Rudder showing a 1.7deg R deflection. We started communication via Automatic Communications Addressing & Reporting System with dispatch and MX. Over the next hour the problem continued to progress to a greater offset and more rudder correction. We tried again to disconnect and manually fly but this time there was no correction to be had. We couldn't level the wings. VERY uneasy feeling in a FBW plane that has no aileron trim installedAt our Time of Departure (Top Of Descent); the first step down; it actually felt like the plane was in a mild 'slip'. Not indicated as much but we were definitely not tracking straight. We took a conservative descent approach. The headwinds helped get us down in time. We vectored into the pattern eventually on the downwind. Everytime we turned (especially to the left) we experienced a very noticeable uncoordinated slip all the way thru the turn. These factors continued to worsen until we passed flaps 2. Then all indications flopped. Rudder inputs remained but opposite aileron and spoiler indications. At 600' we has LH AIL deflected 50-60% down; RH AIL deflected 30-40% up. ALL REMAINING spoilers on RH wing extended normal rudder indications but we were in a slip down the Glideslope (One Word). We increased speed and flew a shallow approach as we had 11;000'+ to land on. It was a positive touchdown in light winds and Visual Flight Rules conditions. We used more braking than reverse for this landing; the rollout was normal. I felt VERY uneasy and out of control while operating this airplane that I have trusted now for 2 1/2 years.When we arrived at the gate; a mechanic (as I requested) met the plane. As I began to enter as much data into the logbook; the First Officer  Heading HDG(S) sends me a picture of the LH wing ... THE LOCKED OUT #4 SPOILER IS DEFLECTED 10-15deg. This is impossible I said to myself! It's locked out electrically via SEC1 and the MX procedure should have had the existing hydraulic pressure holding it in place. We've all read the articles about spoiler float and it can present in different ways; poor rotation or extended TO run; poor handling; rumbling; etc. of which the handling was assumed; initially; to be the missing spoilers.After a very thorough search by our 'unexperienced airbus on call MX' (who worked at night on the line); we discovered the panel WAS NEVER LOCKED OUT. ONLY TWO OF THE THREE STEPS WERE FOLLOWED. This was the 3rd miss by our maintenance team. I talked in great length with 3 different dispatchers; one in training; the duty pilot and my crew about the situation and how we felt the plane may be unsafe to fly. I think what I was looking for was a 100% '... Yes this was a spoiler float event and not electrically influenced ...' We would never receive such a statement. For a large portion of the delay I was convinced I was not moving the plane anywhere. We eventually came to an agreement after several control checks; inspecting the spoilers myself and factoring in all the other 'pros' we had (long runway; Visual Flight Rules; light winds; only 142k) that we would take the plane. We planned on engaging the autopilot very early in the flight and if the wing dipped; even a bit; we were going to declare an emergency; apply the penalty and land overweight. We loaded after an extensive delay. During Engine #2 start; we experienced an IGN B failure that needed to be deferred. I'll just mention here this system has been deferred more than just once. I reluctantly say more than 10 because that may not be factual but if someone was looking at the history; I'd bet I'm not far off. I know they have replaced several parts and continue to troubleshoot but the #2 motors' initial power applications lag; and normal starts have taken 1:40. All significantly different than others but that's another story ... At times this aircraft has carried 8+ MELs at one time. This (and apparently sister ships which are both at out departure airport) are a great barrier to completing on time; reliable and predictable operations for our customers. During this delay; we needed to amend the release for fuel burn AND extend: 30 to complete our mission. At no time did the company or safety or the duty pilot or whoever just ask how we were. Look at this chain of events? It's NOT supposed to be like this. I hope I caught everything I needed to because we were definitely doing the job of SEVERAL departments this day. This was easily one of the top 5 most challenging days I've had here in all my years. The possibility of an aircraft accident was created by incomplete maintenance procedures; and the lack of possibly parts; tools; or personnel to complete either the deferral of a repair. This is supposed to be a fairly routine procedure. This incident indicates a need for properly trained maintenance technicians andsome sort of cross check being implemented for these aircraft. It highlights the need for readdressing how this company perceives its maintenance function. While maintenance may have failed to accomplish a maintenance procedure; other links in the chain held fast. A properly trained crew was able to safely fly a compromised airframe; without further damage. I hope that I have been able to convey the importance of this incident. This event points out how dangerously thin this company's resources are apparently being pulled. It's also apparent that the schedule pressured is obviously elevated at the expense of a thorough procedure. Our [company] does not enjoy the luxury of any mistake!Multiple mechanics doing every Minimum Equipment List procedure. Some system of cross checks MUST be implemented by maintenance.
2,Equipment List,During descent; aircraft displayed the following Marker: DOOR R FWD EMER EXIT. The cabin pressure was normal and the Marker actions were followed. The condition disappeared prior to landing. The day prior; the door seal of the right forward overwing emergency exit was cleaned by Maintenance after Flight Attendants (FA) reported that the emergency exit was making a loud squealing sound. Upon landing; I made a logbook entry to document the Marker received during the flight. LAS Maintenance deferred the discrepancy using Minimum Equipment List - Marker DOOR Page Indications - Over wing Emergency Exits. Upon reviewing the Minimum Equipment List; I noted that this Minimum Equipment List is Repetitive in nature. The FIRST error I observed and had corrected was that Maintenance had placed a yellow deferral sticker on the outside of the logbook vice an orange repetitive deferral sticker as required by Minimum Equipment List. The SECOND error I observed and had corrected was related to the Corrective Action block of the discrepancy in the Logbook. Under the Corrective Action there was no entry documenting that the repetitive Maintenance (Mx) actions of the deferral were complied with. And finally; when I asked Maintenance what the plan was to complete the (M) &(R) items upon landing at my next destination (non-maintenance base); they had not recognized the requirement for a repetitive (Mx) action every leg; and had not devised a plan.It seems; all to often; it is the Captain who is required to catch the errors committed by others. This As Soon As Possible report is submitted with the goal to educate Maintenance to always utilize the color X deferral sticker when appropriate.
2,Equipment List,We reported to the aircraft; reviewed the paperwork; the log book and noted Minimum Equipment List[for] Fwd Lav Deactivated. The Minimum Equipment List denotes conditional statements under Remarks or Exceptions. Specifically; one of the exceptions for this Minimum Equipment List follows:'The Pilot-in-Command will determine if the flight duration is acceptable with a FWD/Upper Deck lavatory unusable...'I had a discussion with the First Officer (First Officer  Heading HDG(S)) explaining why I believe the 'flight duration' for this Minimum Equipment List was not acceptable; giving equal weight to all points.Leaving one pilot on the flight deck for the time it would take to traverse the entire length of the aircraft presents an unnecessary risk to the safe operation of the flight. Considering our destination and the current threat level (Elevated Condition); leaving one pilot on the flight deck while the other transits the cabin creates increased exposure and an unnecessary risk to flight deck security.One of the flight attendants also expressed her concern for flight deck security having one pilot in the back of the aircraft passing through roughly 175 passengers to get to the front of the aircraft.Considering the duration of the flight; it's reasonable to expect that one of the two pilots will need to leave the flight deck at least once to address a physiological need. During flight the passengers will certainly be informed that the Fwd Lav is not usable alerting the attention of any potential 'bad actors' that an opportunity may exist. Additionally; passenger perception of flight safety is negatively impacted when a pilot leaves the flight deck to use the Fwd Lav; not to mention the Aft Lav. Simply stated; passengers don't want to see the pilots flying the airplane; in the back of the airplane...for any reason.And certainly of lesser consideration than safety and security; in the age of Social media everybody has a camera. When a pilot exits the flight deck to use the Aft Lav all the passengers will already know where he's going. I don't believe the Company would appreciate seeing this on the internet; the local news or tabloid TV.To be sure; there is no shortage of scenarios to contemplate when operating under this Minimum Equipment List provided the Pilot-in-Command takes due care to consider them. I called maintenance control to inform them of my decision. The 'flight duration' on this particular flight under this Minimum Equipment List is not acceptable. The Maintenance controller informed me that the Lav will need parts and they will not be able to make repairs.It brings no joy to my heart to have to make this decision but unfortunately for me... it's my decision alone to make. My report to Maintenance control was followed by a phone call from the Chief Pilot (CP). CP began by asking in a very direct and intimidating tone; '...if [destination] is not acceptable...what is acceptable...'. I replied that I could run the airplane up to [a nearby airport]; about a 45 minute flight. That was clearly not the right answer and CP continued with that same line of questioning; '...what is acceptable...'. CP did not seem at all interested in the reasons for my decision and I didn't try to explain my decision to him as he grew more irritated by the minute. As the discussion progressed; it became increasingly obvious to me that the only successful outcome to this conversation was to fly the airplane and accept the Minimum Equipment List; regardless of the circumstances. Needless to say; the conversation ended badly.CP said (quite emphatically) '...You have an airworthy Aircraft... (I respectfully disagreed)....effective immediately both you and the First Officer  Heading HDG(S) are off the trip.....you're both grounded.....you're not flying again until I see you at my desk for a Section 13 hearing...'. He then hung up the phone.The flight was cancelled about 30 minutes after our conversation ended and myself and the First Officer  Heading HDG(S) were provided dead head transportation back to our crew base.Over the past several years I've refused an aircraft on two separate occasions under similar circumstances. In those cases; one resulted in a reasonable delay with an Aircraft swap and the other resulted in a cockpit visit from the Assistant Chief Pilot followed by an aircraft swap. In either case; there was no punitive action; apparently that philosophy has changed.The Minimum Equipment List language has never changed.
2,Equipment List,Out of service placard for 'ALT R BRAKES RELEASED' Marker installed in aircraft. After crew inspected logbook it was noted that there were 12 prior resets by maintenance in the last 6 days for the same known issue. When maintenance showed up to the aircraft to address the write up they immediately started doing a random reset. We challenged them on this and said; 'There is a problem and the issue needs to be fixed rather than continual resets.' Mechanics agreed and started doing more troubleshooting. It was revealed that a brake servo valve was failing when the landing gear was extended. Mechanics asked if we felt comfortable flying with this condition. We said; 'Yes; but only if it could be Minimum Equipment List'd.' After further review it was determined this fault is not an item that can utilize the Minimum Equipment List. Under Marker warnings in the A320 Minimum Equipment List book it specifically states that 'ALTN L(R) FAULT' is no dispatch.Maintenance Control was notified by crew stating we were uncomfortable taking this aircraft to a domestic airport. It was suggested that we call the Chief Pilot stating our case. We then called the Chief Pilot for guidance. He said; 'As long as maintenance signs it off it is a legal aircraft.'Maintenance Control was then called back with a suggestion from us to swap with another aircraft overnighting. They said; 'No; we can't do that because we wouldn't want to send the broken aircraft to <Airport (Foreign)>. So apparently it was okay for us to take it to a domestic airport; but not <Airport (Foreign)>?At this time the 3 mechanics in <Airport  (Domestic)> consulted with each other and refused to sign off the aircraft with a computer reset; due to its past and ongoing history.Maintenance Control was notified and they now decided it was okay to swap aircraft as we had suggested earlier.Due to the time frame; flight crew was now at the flight duty period limitation. Crew scheduling called both Captain and First Officer asking for an extension. Captain and First Officer agreed to the extension.To the best of our knowledge there is no limitation for our airline's maintenance that limits the number of times a faulty system can be reset for the same Marker in a given number of days. Our contract mechanics in <Airport  (Domestic)> mentioned that they do work for another carrier also. At the other carrier a fault can only be reset X number of times in X number of days. This seems like a good policy that would apply to this given situation i.e. continuous write ups with a reset to make the problem go away only temporarily when there is obviously an underlying problem causing the Marker.
2,Equipment List,The Minimum Equipment List/CDL/NEF (Non-Essential for Flight) manual preamble allows deferral stickers to be wrapped around circuit breakers should collars not be available. This seems to be a safety concern (using adhesive material (i.e. glue from deferral placards) on an item that is designed to release/'pop') insomuch as adhesives/glue would/could serve to hinder said design function.Remove such guidance from the Minimum Equipment List and allow operation without collars for a period of time like we used to do.
2,Equipment List,We had an Minimum Equipment List restricting us to FL310. We were climbing out and there were some thunderstorms in the area and as we were going around the weather we leveled at FL300 with a bit of a bumpy ride. It was difficult to determine if we would be on top of the cell ahead and I could see that we were near the tops of the clouds visually. I asked the Captain if he could get us FL320. He said yes; requested it and we climbed to FL320. We cleared the weather and we were at FL320 for about three minutes when I realized our mistake. We then descended to FL300 and completed the flight.
2,Equipment List,Started the flight approximately 1.5 hours late due to late arrival of the aircraft. During our pre-flight; we noted the following four Minimum Equipment List's regarding outer to inner tank fuel transfer valves listed on the Release:28-15-XX (LH valve open) 28-15-YY (RH valve open)28-15-ZY (RH valve closed)28-15-ZX (LH valve closed)We assessed the situation to be that on both the Left and Right sides; one outer tank transfer valve was inop/closed and one was inop/open. Because we had questions/concerns regarding this situation; the Captain contacted [Maintenance Control] via the Dispatcher; per the guidance in FOM. We didn't really have a concern regarding safety (usable vs unusable fuel) since at least one valve per side was inop/open; but wanted to verify the validity of the seemingly conflicting (albeit balanced) Minimum Equipment List's. Even though the 'closed' Minimum Equipment List indicates that one valve is required; we were led to believe the 'inop/open' valve satisfied the intent of the required working valve. The flight was conducted as-dispatched; and operated normally; without incident. Upon arrival; the Captain contacted [Maintenance Control] for an unrelated write-up and was informed at that time that we had a possible issue regarding the application of the fuel Minimum Equipment List's. The final solution was to 'ops-check' the valve functions via circuit breaker reset/configuration checks; and clear the two 'inop/closed' Minimum Equipment List's; leaving the two 'inop/open' Minimum Equipment List's active. Perhaps an experienced maintenance lead/supervisor should double-check the validity of Minimum Equipment List's; especially when multiple related Minimum Equipment List's are applied to the same ship at the same time?
2,Equipment List,During flight plan review; we noted [an] Minimum Equipment List. Reviewing the Minimum Equipment List; we observed that it signifies inoperative Engine Driven Generator; and since 'IDG' was mentioned; we thought that IDG was disconnected. We noted that this Minimum Equipment List comes with several M; O; and DP requirements. One of them being the following maintenance requirement:Install the placards as follows: 1. On the ELEC Panel (35VU) to read: L (R) Engine IDG Inoperative.Therefore; we prepared for and briefed operation with a Single Engine Driven Generator. After engine start; we observed both engine driven generators operating normally; which was unexpected and confusing. We then contacted <Airport  (Domestic)> Station Maintenance thinking that perhaps the generator was repaired but the logbook was not updated. We were told that the Minimum Equipment List was still active; and the problem with the generator still existed; it was not repaired due to lack of parts. We asked them why the generator was operational; and not IDG disconnected or otherwise rendered inoperative as the Minimum Equipment List indicated. We were told that the problem was intermittent; so the generator was left useable. Thoroughly confused by then; we contacted Dispatch about a possible Minimum Equipment List discrepancy. We were told the same story as above; and that the aircraft already operated in the above condition the previous day.Since we were not getting anywhere with this; and not wanting to delay the departure any further; and since safety of operation was not impacted because all generators were operational - we departed for <Airport>. Nevertheless; after further review of the situation; it is my belief that either Maintenance is using this Minimum Equipment List improperly; or the Minimum Equipment List is not written clearly to address the situation as above.Based on my aviation career to this date; if a problem is observed and logbook write-up made; and then Maintenance decides to defer repairs using a Minimum Equipment List; the malfunctioning equipment is rendered inoperative and not used in flight until repaired. Our Minimum Equipment List states: 'Flight Crews will not operate any deactivated or placarded inoperative item or system.' In this situation; dispatched with Minimum Equipment List 24-XX signifies to me operation with inoperative Engine Driven Generator. And yet the generator in question was operative; and we were expected to use it. This; to me; contradicts the letter of our Minimum Equipment List. [The cause was] either incorrect usage of the Minimum Equipment List by Maintenance; or lack of Company guidance that the above described Minimum Equipment List use is indeed approved.If indeed the company and the Federal Aviation Administration approve the usage of the Minimum Equipment List as described above - when a component that faulted - and was written up - is deemed defective; and it is placed on deferral using Minimum Equipment List; but is left operational for as long as it still works - then this should be clearly stated in the Minimum Equipment List; as to preclude flight crew confusion and possible resulting flight delays or cancellations due to flight crew trying to deal with the issue. Otherwise; if faced with similar situation in the future; I will refuse the flight until the Minimum Equipment List is removed; or the component in question [is] deactivated following all the maintenance steps listed in the Minimum Equipment List.
2,Equipment List,We were preparing to fly and the display on the transponder was inoperative. A typical digital display for a single number is made up of seven dashes in the form of a boxy figure eight. The middle dash was not working and one could not read the number that would be put into the first digit of a four digit transponder code. So a number 3 would look like a backwards C.We contacted dispatch who contacted Maintenance and a mechanic came to the airplane. He applied Minimum Equipment List 34-XX-XXX. The Minimum Equipment List says that zero transponders are required as long as certain conditions are met: May be inoperative provided: a) Operations do not require its use; b) Prior to flight; approval is obtained from Air Traffic Control facilities having jurisdiction over planned route of flight; and c) Apply Minimum Equipment List 02-XX-XXX.We avoided operations requiring its use in A. We met the standards of section B by having dispatch contact the appropriate Air Traffic Control's. And C applies to avoiding RVSM airspace so we filed and flew at FL280.  At the bottom of the procedure was the following NOTE: 14 Crash Fire Rescue Equipment 91.215(b) requires [the company] to have one serviceable Air Traffic Control Transponder operative for dispatch at all times; unless otherwise specified per 14 Crash Fire Rescue Equipment 91.215(d) or other appropriated regulations for authorized deviationsI am not sure we were in compliance with the note as we did not have a serviceable transponder due to the Minimum Equipment List. And we had no way to read the language of 14 Crash Fire Rescue Equipment 91.215(d) as that is not referenced in any of our guidance. Further; we had no guidance as to what we were supposed to do with the transponder during flight. Keep it in Standby; Traffic Advisory; or Traffic Advisory/Resolution Advisory. There is also the question about what we would do if we had to squawk an emergency code such as 7500; 7600; or 7700.Pilots need to have a copy of the Crash Fire Rescue Equipment's in our compliance reference materials. The [company] safety team should discuss whether or not it is safe to fly without an operable transponder on a transport category aircraft in revenue service and disseminate those findings to the pilot group. We should have written guidance on what mode to operate the transponder in that has been Minimum Equipment List'd and what to do in case of needing to squawk an emergency type code.
2,Equipment List,Had to perform deactivation of spoiler servo control per Minimum Equipment List. Suspect key may have been defective after lockout procedure; missing prong to return servo to O [position]. Bad tool. [We should ensure] all tools and equipment are in working condition before use.
2,Equipment List,"This flight was the second group of flight segments with this nose number assigned to the Captain's Identification. On Flight an MRM was sent in concerning the incorrect placement and safety wiring of the Emergency Evacuation Signal System - Flight Deck (EESS-Flight Director  High Intensity Approach Light) as described on page 6.10.XX.XX of the A-320 Flight Manual. Note 3 states this switch 'is safety wired to the Captain PURS position.' This switch was observed in the incorrect position and safety wire generating the MRM input.On the following day nose XXXX was again assigned into the sequence of the crew's Identification with an Minimum Equipment List applied to the incorrect positioning of the EESS-Flight Director  High Intensity Approach Light. This Minimum Equipment List placards the 'evacuation alarm signaling system inoperative'. This applied Minimum Equipment List significantly overstated the correction and needlessly restricted the flight crews access to and use of fully operational Evacuate/Evacuation  (S,ED) signally systems. The Frequency Modulation states 'The switch is powered and wired such that regardless of the physical switch position the Captain PURS function is always enabled.' Thus the flight deck; and purser; Evacuate/Evacuation  (S,ED) COMMAND systems remain fully functional at all times. This was in fact verified by the flight crew with [Airport Maintenance] observing while at the gate.When this Minimum Equipment List was read 2 hours prior to scheduled departure during the flight planning process the Captain contacted Dispatch and [Maintenance] to discuss the implications of needlessly inopping a fully functional Evacuate/Evacuation  (S,ED) COMMAND switch. [Maintenance Control] agreed in the Minimum Equipment List assessment of over deferral and [Maintenance Control] would contact [Airport Maintenance] to re-address the deferral.Upon arrival at the aircraft the Captain did not observe any change to the MRD on the aircraft or any line maintenance personal working the discrepancy. [Airport Maintenance] was contacted to ensure they were aware of the issue whereupon the crew was informed that Maintenance personnel would shortly respond to the aircraft. When the two (2) Maintenance personnel arrived a discussion concerning the Frequency Modulation guidance; the actual operational capabilities of the aircraft; and safety implications of overall deferral for the Evacuate/Evacuation  (S,ED) COMMAND system took place. At the end of the discussion the 2 Maintenance personnel stated to the effect of; 'well you can just use the Public Address can't you? So that is good enough. We don't know of another Minimum Equipment List; our discussion is done and we are out of here.' Where upon the Maintenance personnel departed the aircraft; resent the MRD with Minimum Equipment List applied and releasing the aircraft for service.This over application of an Minimum Equipment List; although potentially covering the discrepancy; significantly limited some the possible normal and trained resources for the crew to use during an emergency situation. One solution could be ensuring a proper Minimum Equipment List is in place to address the placement of the Captain PURS and Captain SWITCH assuming this switch position cannot be corrected via simple placement and re-safety wiring. Or addressing the Frequency Modulation by revising the switch positioning to allow either Captain PURS or Captain ONLY since the switch is functional regardless of physical switch position."
2,Equipment List,I noticed during preflight that Marker status page inoperative system column reflected: Fwd Cargo Heat. Aircraft already was carrying Minimum Equipment List 21-XXA. This Minimum Equipment List did not address this specific item in the inoperative system column. Approximately 30 minutes prior to departure; I asked Maintenance to come to the aircraft. When the maintenance person arrived; I explained my concern that the Minimum Equipment List did not specify that 'Fwd Cargo Heat' would be itemized on the status page. Minimum Equipment List only mentioned no live animals or temperature sensitive cargo in forward cargo compartment. The maintenance person ran some tests and made the following statement: Forward Cargo Heat only shows up when the hot air push button sw (Switch) is selected off; so wait to select the hot air push button sw to off. I said that was ridiculous as it does not comply with the Minimum Equipment List. Minimum Equipment List specifies to select hot air push button sw to off during cockpit preparation. The maintenance person said that he didn't know what to tell me. I suggested that if 'Fwd Cargo Heat' was in fact a correct item for this Minimum Equipment List; to make note of it in the AML (Aircraft Maintenance Log); so that I am covered and future crews do not question it as well; since it is not addressed in the Minimum Equipment List. Maintenance person said no he couldn't do that. I suggested a simple notation on the white placard. He said no he couldn't do that. So; I put an entry in the AML stating: 'During preflight; Marker inop sys: fwd cargo heat. Why? Minimum Equipment List 21-XXA does not address this.'He takes AML and sometime later comes back to plane with the following action taken in AML: ' fwd cargo heat checked and approved for deferral per Minimum Equipment List. Entered on mic. Auth# [XXXX]. Deferral item 21-XXB. Cont#[XXXX] Employee #[XXXX].' I reviewed added Minimum Equipment List 21-XXB; noting that this Mel states under (o) (Operations) procedures to: check that the hot air pressure regulating valve is 'indicated closed'. However; Minimum Equipment List 21-XXA states to check that it is 'closed amber.' The cond sd page showed the valve as closed amber. I asked the maintenance person if 'closed amber satisfied the Minimum Equipment List 21-XXB requirement of 'indicated closed.' I explained that I am not going to assume that amber is correct when possibly green is the correct indication for Minimum Equipment List 21-XXB. He stated that Minimum Equipment List 21-XXA takes precedence. I disagreed; explaining that each Minimum Equipment List must be complied with in its entirety. He disagreed. So; I put another entry in AML stating: 'Please confirm that hot air press reg valve indicating closed 'amber' complies with Minimum Equipment List 21-XXB. Minimum Equipment List 21-XXB stated to verify 'indicated closed.'' He takes AML and sometime later 2 maintenance persons come back to plane with the following action taken in AML (exact wording): 'comply with Minimum Equipment List 21-XXB on display page sys Marker verify and o/h button off in I.A.W. Minimum Equipment List ok for contuted service tech sys notified.' I stated that this sign off does not address my write up; as it does not state that 'amber' is correct. I asked them why they didn't sign it off by stating clearly that 'amber' is correct? They stated they aren't allowed to state that. I called Dispatch; explained the issue; and Dispatch transferred me to [Maintenance Operations]. [Maintenance Operations] immediately tried to tell me that Minimum Equipment List 21-XXB stated 'closed amber.' I corrected [Maintenance Operations] stating that this Minimum Equipment List stated 'closed.' [Maintenance Operations] then stated that Minimum Equipment List 21-XXA stated 'closed amber' so he will assume that it is correct.I explained that I was fully aware of that wording for Mel 21-XXA and I was not going to assume that amber was correct for Mel 21-XXB. If amber is in fact correct; I asked that the AML be signed off stating that amber is correct; since the Minimum Equipment List is written quite unclear. [Maintenance Operations] said they couldn't sign it off any other way; as it would be outside the boundaries of complying with Minimum Equipment List sign offs. I disagreed and stated that they are required to answer clearly any question a Captain has written up in the AML. [Maintenance Operations] disagreed and stated that if Mel 21-XXB was the only Minimum Equipment List that I would not have an issue. I disagreed and stated I definitely would have since amber wasn't specified in that Minimum Equipment List. [Maintenance Operations] then stated that this conversation is over. I handed the AML back to the maintenance persons and stated that I am refusing the Aircraft per my FOM (Flight Operations Manual) as I am not satisfied that it is safe or legal. They left with the AML. I called [<Airport  (Domestic)> Director of Flight Operations]; Chief [Pilot 1]; Chief [Pilot 2] and Duty Pilot. Duty Pilot called back. I explained the situation. He stated that he was talking to [Maintenance Operations]. Sometime later another mechanic arrived with the AML. I had the Dispatcher on my phone so that Dispatcher could hear my conversation with this mechanic. I asked this mechanic if it would be alright to let the Dispatcher listen in. He said yes. I explained my concern to this mechanic. He seemed receptive. He left with the AML. He returned sometime later with additional maintenance papers that explained valve positions and colors. I explained to him that all that I needed; all that I ever needed was a confirmation on the fwd cargo heat inop sys Marker (with an AML notation somewhere) and now all I need is a confirmation on the amber indication. I stated that if you feel that amber is correct and you can state it in AML; I will take the plane. He wrote in the AML (actual wording): 'per AMM (Aircraft Maintenance Manual) 31-XX-XX description & operation hor air sov valve closed & green and amber indication on ecam both indicate valve is fully closed and meet Mel's 21-XXA and 21-XXB ok for continued service Employee # [XXX].' We then pushed 2 hours and 25 minutes late. I explained the above proceedings to Dispatch on a recorded line. I sent a message to Dispatch via Automatic Communications Addressing & Reporting System explaining my last write up and my concerns. There is no explanation other than blatant disregard for a Captain's concern of operating legally and safely. Maintenance inability to hold an intelligent conversation with a flight crew. Line maintenance and [Maintenance Operations] handled my concerns with complete incompetence. There's no excuse. They should be held accountable. I was dealing with maintenance for 2 hours and 30 minutes. Line maintenance in [<Airport>] and [Maintenance Operations] clearly have no interest in acting in a professional; legal; and safe manner with a flight crew's concerns....telling me to wait to turn a switch off; telling me that one Minimum Equipment List overrides another; telling me that they can't answer a Captain's question clearly in writing; telling me that it would be outside the boundaries of Minimum Equipment List compliance to do so; applying Minimum Equipment List 21-XXB to the plane when possibly it wasn't supposed to be applied (if it was; why was it not already on the plane?); and taking 2 hours and 30 min to get a sign off (from a fourth mechanic) that [Maintenance Operations] stated that they couldn't legally do. The flight back from ZZZ2 on this plane was delayed as well. Over 200 passengers.
2,Equipment List,I was assigned aircraft with Minimum Equipment List 31-XXc applied. Navigation Display 1 was inoperative. After considering that the first third of the flight was to overfly Marginal Visual Flight Rules/Instrument Flight Rules conditions; the first hour of the flight would be spent circumnavigating thunderstorms; and then the destination was LAX; with its complex and potentially shifting approaches; I elected to refuse the aircraft in this condition. I notified the Duty Pilot and maintenance and received a different airplane. I must emphasize that once I voiced my concern everyone involved was more than happy to help me. I couldn't help but wonder why the airplane flew for four days like that. The Minimum Equipment List allows this to go on for 10 days. Ironically; a jump seat has to [be] repaired in two days. The only mechanism in place to get the airplane fixed promptly is for the Captain to intervene. And I understanding after going through it; it can be somewhat intimidating. It makes sense to have an Minimum Equipment List in place in order to recover the aircraft from to [a maintenance base] under appropriate conditions. It's certainly not acceptable to allow the aircraft pass through [a maintenance base] without repairing it. In fact; the plane passed through five opportunities for repair without being addressed.  I can see how this would evolve. The first crew gets it to [a maintenance base] and passes it off to the second crew. The second crew sees it is all legal and that the first crew flew it; so it becomes a mission hack. But we do ourselves a disservice. I think it would be constructive if one of the crews called after their flight and said: 'Hey we just flew this thing in and you need to fix it for the next crew'. I believe our company would be responsive to this. And it would save time. I also think that this Minimum Equipment List should have a much tighter time limit: one or two legs. That should apply to 31-XXa; b; and c. And maintenance should have a more robust tracking system in place to support our Primary Flight Displays so they get fixed. By the way; XXc allows Clear Air Turbulence  System Sequenced Flashers (Cat  Config) 1200RVR with the FOs ND out.
2,Equipment List,The first three words; 'before each flight' in the [MELs]. On this round trip; we were schedule to fuel in each location; so 'before each refueling' also applied.In an effort to be proactive; I called the Dispatcher and asked if we could verify that Contract Maintenance would be available to perform this check in the outstation. The Dispatcher seemed entirely unaware of what Minimum Equipment List I was referring to. He made a comment indicating that he didn't see that requirement and then said he would transfer the call to include [Technical Support Maintenance Control]. After holding the on the phone; the call was disconnected. I sent the Dispatcher an Automatic Communications Addressing & Reporting System and I received an email to my company email (and the same response via Automatic Communications Addressing & Reporting System) that stated; 'Sir. Sorry I dropped your call! In regards to the Minimum Equipment List; it is not a check each flight item.'I then called the Dispatcher back and read the Minimum Equipment List to him. He indicated that he did not read it but was basing his response on what [Technical Support Maintenance Control] told him. I asked to be connected with [Technical Support Maintenance Control] and; once connected; [Technical Support Maintenance Control] agreed with me and said that if the Minimum Equipment List says each flight; it will be checked in the outstation and they will coordinate it.This experience comes after another recent flight experience where I called the Dispatcher to clarify Minimum Equipment List language. During that call; with a separate Dispatcher; a Pack Inoperative Minimum Equipment List was dispatched with another PACK related CDL. The PACK Minimum Equipment List had a note that it could not be dispatched with another other PACK related Minimum Equipment List in the same chapter. I called to confirm that the reference to the Minimum Equipment List didn't include the open CDL of a missing PACK exhaust flap and that they weren't in the same Chapter. When I called; that Dispatcher said; 'Oh; I didn't even see that (...) where are you looking for that?' Once he read it; he said he didn't know the answer and we conferenced in [Technical Support Maintenance Control]. The reason for this report is to express concern and discomfort that our dispatchers seem task saturated beyond a point at which they can reliably and thoroughly review each release; specifically related to the MELs and CDLs that affect the flight. The workload they are given appears to force a mindset of a need to maintain operational performance; which appears to cause their process to simply become; 'if it's legal; it must be safe'. I called two dispatchers; on two flights; related to two different MELs and; in both cases; neither one even knew of the existence of the Minimum Equipment List I was referring to in the release they sent me.
2,Equipment List,The purpose of this report is to identify a possible Minimum Equipment List discrepancy as it pertains to the A300-600F operated at [company]. When we received our flight paperwork; it included Minimum Equipment List 23-XX-XX-X-X-X for an inoperative interphone system. This Minimum Equipment List was used to defer the system (the flight deck to ground function) after another crew wrote up difficulty communicating with the mechanic during their engine starts. We planned to use hand signals for engine starts to comply with the operations procedures of the Minimum Equipment List.During preflight of my oxygen mask; I discovered that I was unable to hear through the flight deck interphone system (overhead speakers) when transmitting. A closer review of the Minimum Equipment List title indicated that the flight deck interphone system was assumed to be inoperative. The full Minimum Equipment List title is: 'CREWMEMBER INTERPHONE SYSTEM - CARGO CONFIGURATION - FLIGHT DECK TO GROUND FUNCTION: (FLIGHT DECK AND SERVICE INTERPHONE SYSTEMS INOPERATIVE).' So; per the Minimum Equipment List; the aircraft appeared to be legal for dispatch. However; I discussed with the Captain my safety concern that we would have no way to communicate while wearing oxygen masks during flight (reasons would include smoke/fire/rapid decompression) if the flight deck interphone system was inoperative or deferred. The Captain put the flight deck interphone system discrepancy in the logbook; assuming the same Minimum Equipment List would be used to defer it. Had that been the case; I would have been forced to refuse to fly the aircraft because of the potential inability to communicate during an emergency requiring oxygen masks. Fortunately; the mechanics were able to replace the radio interphone amplifier and clear the write up and deferral. [Company] A300 procedures require the use of the interphone system and the overhead speakers for crew communications while using the oxygen masks. I am questioning the applicability of any Minimum Equipment List that would defer the flight deck interphone system on the A300.
2,Equipment List,During review of flight release; preflight duties we discovered the aircraft had a minimum equipment item that deferred the flight-deck-to-ground; service interphone system. We reviewed the Minimum Equipment List and noted that we would have to use hand signals and prior coordination with ground support personnel during engine start and taxi. This flight was scheduled as a quick-turn and Maintenance did not plan on any repair of the interphone system.During cockpit preflight duties; the First Officer discovered the cockpit oxygen mask interphone system was inoperative. We tested both the cockpit speaker system and headphone system at both seats and discovered all systems were inoperative. We checked the service interphone system and it was also inoperative. I immediately called the company dispatcher and advised him of our situation. He called me back several minutes later and stated that Maintenance advised him the Minimum Equipment List was appropriate for our situation and it was airworthy at that point. I disagreed with their assessment. The First Officer and I agreed the Minimum Equipment List was not germane to our problem. The Dispatcher then suggested we solicit the help of a company SME (Subject Matter Expert). I agreed and was called later by the SME. When the SME called I discussed my situation; he then discussed the matter with Maintenance and informed me the Minimum Equipment List was appropriate according to aircraft Maintenance. After several minutes passed; a local gateway Maintenance Supervisor responded and promptly had the interphone amplifier removed and replaced. This resolved our problem. Our issue was the result of no cockpit interphone capability. This issue was not to be confused with no cockpit-to-ground and ground-to-cockpit interphone capability (per the stated Minimum Equipment List). We were unable to satisfy company aircraft operating procedures (test interphone operation of oxygen mask); company and aircraft flight manual emergency procedures (smoke/fumes- oxygen masks on; crew communications established). Ultimately; per FAR part 121 regulations; we believed we could not operate this flight safely. The flight crew recommends the Minimum Equipment List be edited to address loss of intra-cockpit interphone capability.
2,Equipment List,When we arrived at the gate; maintenance had to reapply an Minimum Equipment List that was just cleared. The Minimum Equipment List was being re-issued; it was 27-XX (ELAC) [Elevator Aileron Computer]. The First Officer  Heading HDG(S) (First Officer) and I reviewed the Minimum Equipment List and decided on doing the action items because it dealt with checking the flight controls which meant the hydraulics were pressurized. I realized my error when I was unable to turn on the blue hydraulic pump; on the maintenance panel; to ON after engines start after pushback. The switch would not lock into the ON position. I contacted Maintenance Control via Dispatch and Maintenance Control said to go back to the gate. Maintenance came to the airplane and I explained what happen. The Technician mentioned why the blue hydraulic pump would not turn on; because the system was energized. After he said that; I said you were right and remembered you cannot turn on the switch with engines running. Then we discussed the action items on the Minimum Equipment List. We both; along with First Officer  Heading HDG(S); were in agreement about how the Minimum Equipment List was written; not in a clear manner. No where does it say to perform the action items with the engines off. The way the action items are written; such as C then D; it only adds to confusion. When you complete action item C; you have completed the task. When you go to D; nowhere does it mention to perform the rest of the action items at the gate or remote area with the engines not running. We performed the action items at the gate and proceeded on our flight.Clarity of the Minimum Equipment List needs to be improved. This Minimum Equipment List is extremely rarely issued; ELACs are extremely reliable. Make mention this must be done at the gate due to the blue hydraulic system must be turned on via the maintenance overhead panel; engines running locks the switch from turning on.
2,Equipment List,Aircraft X had landed in <Airport  (Domestic)> we had an inbound write up for Engine #1 abnormal bleed IP valve would not open. I had called Maintenance Control; told them the write up and they directed me to apply Minimum Equipment List 36-XX-XXX and Minimum Equipment List 36-XX-XXX. During the application of this Minimum Equipment List the flight crew was going with they're procedures for this Minimum Equipment List and had no issue with it. Note: HP bleed valve for same engine was already on Minimum Equipment List 36-XX-XXX; nowhere in the maintenance procedures for any of these MELs does it indicate that you can't have all of them applied. Flight crew took Aircraft X from <Airport  (Domestic)> to <Airport> the next day I was notified by my supervisor that the wrong Minimum Equipment List had been applied. Mel 36-XX-XXX is the Minimum Equipment List that should have been applied not Minimum Equipment List 36-XX-XXX. This was discovered by the flight crew that was taking Aircraft X out of <Airport> and they had a conflict with the operation procedures. The maintenance procedures for the bleed system when multiple things are failing are not clear. There's nothing in the maintenance procedures to keep you from applying MELs that counter act each other.The maintenance procedures for the bleed system when multiple things are failing are not clear. There's nothing in the maintenance procedures to keep you from applying MELs that counter act each other.
2,Equipment List,When I arrived in the morning the aircraft had Minimum Equipment List 76-XX-XX on the plane; thrust lever position sensor for #2 Engine. After the Captain looked at the logbook and checked [that there was] no open write-ups; I doubled-checked his work and [the aircraft's] airworthiness [and] determined [it] was competed. [I] looked up the Minimum Equipment List in the Minimum Equipment List-CDL-NEF manual and checked that all conditions were met; which they were. Flew up to EUG with no issues.Coming back to <Airport  (Domestic)>; we were cleared visual XXL and about ready to intercept [the] localizer and glide slope; when the #2 Engine rolled back to idle power. Along with the roll back of engine #2; [we] got Marker Engine 2 THR LEVER DISAGREE. [The] Captain asked to cancel the approach; being outside the FAF - and also to give us time to figure out what the issues was. We [requested priority handling]. [We] ran the Marker; followed by [the] FCOM to review any other information. [We] checked [the] performance along with [the] North N Quick Reference Handbook one engine inoperative straight-in approach. Thrust Lever Two was unresponsive to any inputs and engine stayed at idle thrust. [We] briefed [the] flight attendants for yellow emergency along with what was going on and time remaining. [We] briefed [the] passengers saying we had a thrust lever or throttle that was not responding correctly; we ran the checklists and we will be landing shortly and I appreciated their patience. Landed without any further issues and taxied to the gate. As of today I found out that Maintenance applied the wrong Minimum Equipment List to the aircraft. Preventing measures would include double-checking all of Maintenance's work more closely. But I do not have all the information. I do not know the fault codes that they see and what path those faults may take them down [to] or what their troubleshooting checks look like. It is hard; if not impossible; to determine the course of action they take to a write-up and if it's correct or not. As pilots; we rely on Maintenance Control to implement due diligence when implementing an Minimum Equipment List.
2,Equipment List,In the logbook and on our flight plan we had Minimum Equipment List 27-88-02 which was suppose to deactivate the Kruger flap system. The logbook was reviewed and the Minimum Equipment List was discussed between the First Officer and myself. All the placards were in place and signed off by maintenance that the DMP was accomplished. We started the aircraft and taxied out to the runway. I did notice a Kruger light on the SFPI; which was in the Minimum Equipment List that it might be displayed. We took off and climbed out. As we retracted the slats we received an Marker warning and a single chime. The First Office was flying so I handled the Marker. The Marker message showed a Kruger not retracted and a notation of Maximum SPD 300KIAS/.65. We did our after takeoff flows and checklist and I told the First Officer to fly the airplane and to not exceed the speed shown in the notation on Marker. I did remember that besides getting the Kruger light that you could also get an Marker message saying Kruger Fault. This was not the message we received after bringing up the flaps. I decided to get Maintenance Control on the line with Dispatch. I queried the maintenance people about our situation. I explained what we were showing and that it did not correspond with the Minimum Equipment List we had in the log book. We both concluded that if we could we would continue .65/300 knots. Maintenance was sure that the Minimum Equipment List was complied with and that it was probably an erroneous message; but to be safe we would comply with the speeds on the Marker. After a discussion with dispatch about extra fuel burn and a longer duration flight we decided we were safe even if the Kruger Flap was extended. The dispatcher did run the numbers for fuel burn with Kruger Flap extended. The flight was uneventful and we landed with no further problems. I did make a comment in the logbook about what had transpired during the flight so if this was an anomaly maintenance could add this message to the Minimum Equipment List. We exited the aircraft where I noticed the Kruger Flap on the left side of the aircraft was partially extended. I immediately got the mechanics involved and told them of the situation. We headed to hotel for a 3 hour layover where we were to return to fly later. After returning to the gateway; and heading to the same aircraft we noticed the gear doors down and a panel on the wing root open. I met up with the maintenance people and asked if there was a problem. He told me that the aircraft was out of service. I asked him what was going on and we were told that the DMP for the KRUGER Flap Minimum Equipment List had not been complied with even though it had been stated so in the log book. Our flight was eventually cancelled as they were having some issues with the log book and could not do the DMP for this Minimum Equipment List.
2,Equipment List,Aircraft X arrived in <Airport  (Domestic)> with a PIREP (Pilot Report) 'AMBER Marker Message COND FWD CRG ISOL VALVE'. A history check revealed that the aircraft had the same fault on [the day prior] and Minimum Equipment List 21-XXX C/N 11XXXXX was applied. The Minimum Equipment List (Minimum Equipment List) was cleared by <Airport> Maintenance on the RON (Remain Overnight) and the fault repeated during [the] flight to <Airport  (Domestic)>. Since it didn't complete 1 flight cycle before faulting again I re-opened the Minimum Equipment List 21-XXX C/N 11XXXXX. About 1/2 hour later began researching for a TSM (Trouble Shooting Manual) and parts to update the item and that is when I found that the aircraft does not have a FWD cargo isolation valve installed. The Minimum Equipment List does not contain any effectivity information and the aircraft was clearly faulting a FWD cargo isolation valve. I had never heard of an Airbus displaying an Marker (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) fault of a component that is not installed in the aircraft and had no reason to question that Minimum Equipment List 21-XXX was not an acceptable deferral for the fault.If aircraft effectivity was contained in the Minimum Equipment List this would have been avoided.
2,Equipment List,Maintenance Controller reported miscommunication over an Minimum Equipment List that allowed an aircraft to fly in a non-airworthy status.[Maintenance] in <Airport  (Domestic)> called about Aircraft X had a 24 ELEC FAULT GEN Inoperative message. Several attempted resets with no help. A Minimum Equipment List was mentioned. Initial read through of the Minimum Equipment List and procedures appeared to be able to defer left generator. RTM was not generating any faults related to aircraft for chapter 24 at the time message was present on aircraft. I got dispatch approval and deferred Left generator with [Maintenance] reference log number XXXXXXX. After engine start noticed that RTM had generated a fault for Left Generator 24 ELEC FAULT GEN Inoperative with a no dispatch under the reference column. Reread the Minimum Equipment List and found an exception for Information Message 24 ELEC FAULT GEN Inoperative making it a non-dispatchable Minimum Equipment List with this message. Immediately attempted to contact <Airport  (Domestic)> maintenance and the flight crew of the aircraft to prevent Take off. The aircraft had already departed for <Airport>. Contacted <Airport> maintenance about Minimum Equipment List not being dispatchable and that it would have to be fixed prior to departure from <Airport>. Applied a CAR to lock down aircraft in <Airport> on arrival. <Airport> maintenance worked the item and was able to repair per A220 FIM and clear log item. To prevent future occurrences a highlight or bullet point in the section of the Minimum Equipment List for not being able to dispatch with that Message. Making it easier to identify message.
2,Equipment List,I; Name; <Airport  (Domestic)> Line Mechanic; called Maintenance Control Name 1 to placard the ATSU (Air Traffic Service Unit) on Minimum Equipment List 46-XX Actual Time Of Arrival 46-YY on Date at <Airport  (Domestic)> Airport; Aircraft X. I did not know that the aircraft had a previous Minimum Equipment List 46-ZZ under Actual Time Of Arrival 23-AA.On aircraft equipped with ATSU; the Minimum Equipment List 46-ZZ under Actual Time Of Arrival 46-YY is normally used. The aircraft in <Airport> airport was Minimum Equipment List using Actual Time Of Arrival 23-AA instead of Actual Time Of Arrival 46-YY. As a result; I only checked the 30 days history for Actual Time Of Arrival 46-YY. Consequently; the aircraft did not make a successful flight after the last repair and I should have had reopened the previous Minimum Equipment List under Actual Time Of Arrival 23-AA instead of creating a new one.When placing a Minimum Equipment List on an aircraft equipped with an ATSU; the Minimum Equipment List 46-XX Actual Time Of Arrival 46-YY should be used. However; I will look at both Actual Time Of Arrival 46 and Actual Time Of Arrival 23 history in the future to be sure nothing gets missing.
2,Equipment List,Mechanics were working on the airplane when we arrived at the gate. An Minimum Equipment List was created: 21-XX Skin Air Outlet Valve (MMEL 21-XX-XX) and signed off. We were about to push back and the avionics door reopened. Captain and I went outside multiple times to check on status and mechanic was back in the avionics compartment. Once done; after maybe 20 minutes the mechanic came up to the flight to apologize and said that his colleague forgot to bag the loose connections but that now everything was done and in order. Both the captain and I at that point decided to depart as everything was in order. All doors were closed. Everything went normally until the takeoff. During the TO roll an Marker message appeared and we decided to continue as it seemed related to the Minimum Equipment List. After takeoff more Marker messages appeared mentioning that the max altitude was 10000 ft. We weren't pressurizing at that point and decided to level off at 10000 ft. We advised Air Traffic Control. Went into a hold. Ran all checklists. We decided to burn fuel in order to be below max landing weight. We did [request priority handling]. Once max landing weight was reached we went back to LAX for ILS25L. We got into the wake turbulence of a 737 at about 3000 ft and had to turn the autopilot off to recover. Then the landing and taxi to gate was normal. No assistance needed from safety vehicles. Cause: Maintenance might have made a mistake following that Minimum Equipment List causing the aircraft not to pressurize. Extra attention should be given to MELs.
2,Equipment List,SDQ-MIA; A300 Aircraft. 2 Minimum Equipment List PLACARDS WERE PUT ON THIS Flight WHICH WERE ILLEGAL. 1 Minimum Equipment List AUTHORIZES (Minimum Equipment List 32-1) LNDG GEAR INDICATING PANEL MAY BE Inoperative; PROVIDED ALL VISUAL DOWN LOCKS (Minimum Equipment List 32-2) ARE OPERATIVE. IT STATES IT IS OK TO PLACARD 1 ITEM Intermediate Fix THE OTHER IS OPERATIVE BUT BOTH WERE PLACARDED. THE DISCREPANCY WAS FOUND BY THE Captain OF THE Flight WHO HAD 1 ITEM FIXED. DISPATCHER DID NOT DETECT THIS PROB BECAUSE EITHER OF THE PLACARDS REQUIRED DISPATCH NOTIFICATION.
2,Equipment List,"THIS WAS THE 5TH MORNING OF A 5 DAY TRIP. UPON ARRIVING AT THE Aircraft; PROCEEDED WITH PREFLT Check. CHKING THE ELECTRICAL System VERT(LY) Vertical; FOUND ALTERNATING CURRENT (Alternating Current) ESSENTIAL BUS PWRED BY BOTH Alternating Current BUS 1 AND 2 (NORMALLY ONLY PWRED BY Alternating Current BUS 1). THIS IS A GLASS COCKPIT Aircraft. CALLED Maintenance (Local AND OUR COMPANY). DURING THEIR TROUBLE-SHOOTING; ETC; CIRCUIT BREAKERS WERE PULLED AND ELECTRICAL Administration Power WAS REMOVED AND PUT ON THE Aircraft AT LEAST 3 TIMES. 1 (S,LY) Hour AND 10 MINS AFTER SCHEDULED DEP THE FAULTY COMPONENT HAD BEEN LOCATED; CHANGES WERE MADE AND WE WERE DISPATCHED UNDER THE APPLICABLE Minimum Equipment List. WE PUSHED BACK AT PM20 Local AND STARTED ENGS. THE PUSHBACK CREW WAS RELEASED AND I CALLED FOR THE BEFORE TAXI CHKLIST. WHEN THE First Officer  Heading HDG(S) CHKED THE STATUS PAGE OF THE Marker (CRT) IT SHOWED Inoperative System VERT(LY) Vertical OF AUTOPLT #2 AND Clear Air Turbulence  System III Inoperative. (MUST HAVE BOTH AUTOPLTS FOR Clear Air Turbulence  System III.) WE CHKED CIRCUIT BREAKERS IN AND CONSULTED OUR COMPANY OPERATING MANUAL; SPECIFIC PROBS PER Actual Time Of Arrival CODES FOR Aircraft System VERT(LY) Vertical. CONSULTED Minimum Equipment List AND FOUND WE COULD GO WITHOUT AUTOPLT #2. (WE ARE STILL JUST OUTSIDE OF GATE AREA WITH ENGS (2) RUNNING. LET ME DIGRESS SOME -- OUR COMPANY HAS SET FORTH SPECIFIC GUIDELINES IN OUR COMPANY Flight OPS MANUAL TO HANDLE SUCH SITS ACCORDING TO WHETHER YOU ARE AT THE GATE; HAVE PUSHED OFF THE GATE; OR AIRBORNE OR NOT. THIS IS FURTHER DEFINED ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE Minimum Equipment List ITEM IN THE Minimum Equipment List BOOK IS A 'BOXED' ITEM (BLACK LINE BORDER AROUND Minimum Equipment List NUMBER) OR NOT. ALL BOXED ITEM Minimum Equipment List'S REQUIRES A DIRECT LINK WITH OUR Flight DISPATCHER FOR HIS CONCURRENCE OF SAFETY OF Flight; ETC; AND HE MUST INCLUDE THE Minimum Equipment List ON THE RELEASE AND AMEND IT WITH SIGNATURE (DISPATCHER) AND DATE AND TIME OF AMENDMENT. OUR Flight OPS MANUAL STATES THAT THE DISPATCHER IS THE PERSON WHO MUST BE CALLED -- NOT Maintenance; SO THAT ONE CENTRAL PERSON IN CHARGE OF THE Flight CAN COORDINATE THE Situation Between US AND Maintenance. I WROTE AUTOPLT #2 Inoperative IN THE LOGBOOK AS REQUIRED. WE CONTACTED DISPATCH WITH THE PROB AND Minimum Equipment List THAT WE THOUGHT WE COULD DEPART UNDER. HE AGREED AND HE AMENDED OUR RELEASE TO INCLUDE THAT BOXED Minimum Equipment List. I HAD FILLED OUT AN Minimum Equipment List STICKER CONCERNING AUTOPLT #2; AND PLACED IT ACCORDING TO COMPANY GUIDELINES. THE Flight OPS MANUAL FURTHER STATES THAT Maintenance Control WILL GIVE ME THE REQUIRED Information TO FILL OUT THE SECOND HALF OF THE LOG PAGE -- THE Minimum Equipment List CORRECTIVE ACTION; WITH Maintenance EMPLOYEE NAME; EMPLOYEE NUMBER; ETC. THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS PART OF THIS RPT. THE DISPATCHER DID NOT GET THIS Information FOR US (REQUIRED BY TIME OF LNDG) BEFORE OR AFTER DEPARTING. I SENT SEVERAL DETAILED MESSAGES TO DISPATCH AND Maintenance Control BY Automatic Communications Addressing & Reporting System DURING THE 2 1/2 (S,LY) Hour Flight WITHOUT EVER RECEIVING THIS REQUIRED Information. AT DEST (MSP) Aircraft WAS MET BY 2 Federal Aviation Administration INSPECTORS (TYPE UNKNOWN). COMPANY Maintenance MAN AT THE GATE SAID THEY WERE THERE TO INSPECT COCKPIT SIDE WINDOWS FROM A PRIOR WRITE- UP. WE HAD ANOTHER Flight TO FLY IN 40 MINS SO WE HAD TO LEAVE (Aircraft CHANGE). I DID HEAR THAT THE Aircraft WE BROUGHT IN WAS SENT TO THE HANGAR BY Federal Aviation Administration. SUPPOSEDLY TO FIX WINDOWS. I DON'T KNOW Intermediate Fix ANY ACTION WILL BE TAKEN DUE TO THE 'INCOMPLETE' LOG PAGE. FURTHER COMMENT: IN RETROSPECT; AUTOPLT #2 WAS PROBABLY Inoperative DUE TO Flight MGMNT AND GUIDANCE COMPUTER #2 WAS PROBABLY Inoperative. NOT KNOWN TO US UNTIL AFTER TKOF AND DURING CLBOUT OF PHX."
2,Equipment List,I PICKED UP MY DISPATCH RELEASE NOTING IT CONTAINED AN Minimum Equipment List AND PROCEEDED TO THE Aircraft. ARRIVING AT THE Aircraft MY First Officer  Heading HDG(S) HAD THE Minimum Equipment List BOOK OUT AND THE Minimum Equipment List LOOKED UP. SHE INFORMED ME THAT HER OPINION WAS THAT WE COULD NOT BE DISPATCHED WITH THIS Minimum Equipment List. I READ THE Minimum Equipment List AND AGREED WITH HER THAT I TOO INTERPRETED THE Minimum Equipment List TO NOT ALLOW DISPATCH. THE Minimum Equipment List ON THE RELEASE WAS AS FOLLOWS: Minimum Equipment List L #1 FUEL PUMP Inoperative. IN THE Minimum Equipment List BOOK THE Minimum Equipment List READS AS FOLLOWS: SINCE THERE IS NO WORD 'OR' Between THE 2 EXCEPTIONS; I BELIEVE THEY BOTH APPLY. IE: EXCEPTION ONE MEANS THAT NO PUMPS MAY BE Inoperative WHEN JP4 IS USED. EXCEPTION TWO MEANS Intermediate Fix JP4 IS NOT USED THEN ONE #2 PUMP MAY BE Inoperative. Maintenance Control DISPATCH; AND OUR A320 FLEET Manager ASSURED ME IT WAS OK TO DISPATCH. THEIR Interpretation  Medium Intensity Approach OF THE Minimum Equipment List WAS THAT EXCEPTION ONE MEANT THAT YOU COULD HAVE ANY ONE PUMP Inoperative AS Longitude AS JP4 WAS NOT USED. THEY BELIEVED THAT EXCEPTION TWO; 'ONE PUMP #2 MAY BE Inoperative;' ONLY APPLIED WHEN JP4 IS USED. I THINK YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT THIS Minimum Equipment List IS OPEN TO Interpretation  Medium Intensity Approach. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE TO HAVE AN Minimum Equipment List THAT IS OPEN TO Interpretation  Medium Intensity Approach. VERY RELUCTANTLY I OPERATED THE Flight. ALTHOUGH I BELIEVED THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY THAT I COULD COMPLETE THE Flight SAFELY I STILL BELIEVE THAT I WAS DISPATCHED INCORRECTLY.
2,Equipment List,DURING COCKPIT SET-UP I DISCOVERED THE #1 FUEL USED (TOTALIZER) ON THE LOWER Marker Engine PAGE HAD AN AMBER LINE THROUGH IT. THIS; ALONG WITH A 'ZERO' INDICATION; LED ME TO SUSPECT IT WAS Inoperative. Maintenance IN <Airport  (Domestic)> WAS CALLED; AND THEY DISPATCHED AN Air Carrier Service International Civil Aviation Mechanic TO LOOK AT IT. THE Captain LOOKED UP THE DISCREPANCY IN THE Minimum Equipment List BOOK. THE Air Carrier Service International Civil Aviation Mechanic PERFORMED THE REQUIRED System VERT(LY) Vertical TESTS; AND SIGNED OFF THE DISCREPANCY IN THE LOGBOOK. THE DISPATCHER IN COMPANY Maintenance REGISTERED THE Minimum Equipment List AND SIGNED OFF THE COMPANY RADIO FREQ. WHILE THE Captain WAS RESEARCHING THE Minimum Equipment List; I RECALL HIM SAYING SOMETHING LIKE 'Intermediate Fix THE FUEL USED INDICATION IS BAD; THE FUEL FLOW IS ALSO GOING TO BE Inoperative.' I THOUGHT THE TWO WERE RELATED; AND THE RELIEF PROVIDED BY THE Minimum Equipment List FOR THE FUEL USED INDICATION ALSO APPLIED TO ANY FUTURE FUEL FLOW INDICATION PROB. WHEN WE STARTED THE #1 Engine; THE #1 FUEL FLOW INDICATOR ON THE UPPER Marker WAS NOT FUNCTIONING. WE TAXIED OUT AND TOOK OFF WITH THE FUEL FLOW INDICATOR Inoperative. I DIDN'T THINK TO QUESTION IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT Minimum Equipment List RELIEF WAS PROVIDED WITH THE PREVIOUS FUEL USED INDICATOR WRITE-UP. ALSO; THE Captain'S COMMENTS WHILE HE HAD THE Minimum Equipment List BOOK OPEN; IE; 'THE FUEL FLOW WILL PROBABLY BE Inoperative ALSO' LED ME TO BELIEVE WE HAD Minimum Equipment List RELIEF. DURING CRUISE; THE Captain LOOKED THROUGH THE Minimum Equipment List BOOK AGAIN AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THERE WAS NO Minimum Equipment List RELIEF FOR AN Inoperative FUEL FLOW GAUGE. WE HAD POSSIBLY TAKEN OFF WITH A NO-GO ITEM.
2,Equipment List,"WE HAD AN Aircraft WITH AN Marker Message L SPOILER #4 FAULT. AFTER TRYING TO DO THE RESET PROC IT DID NOT WORK. WE NOTED THAT THE RESET PROC HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ACCOMPLISHED. AT THIS WE TALKED TO Maintenance Control Center AND DECIDED TO PLACE THEM ON Minimum Equipment List. WE ACCOMPLISHED THE Minimum Equipment List LOCKOUT PROC AND HAD THE Flight Crew VERIFY THIS BY AN OPS Check WHICH WAS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THE SPOILERS DID NOT RAISE. THE Aircraft HEADED TO XXX FROM <Airport  (Domestic)> AND ON HIS WAY INTO XXX THEY DECLARED AND EMER BECAUSE THE L #4 SPOILER CAME UP ABOUT 2 IN. THEY LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT AND AFTER TAXI TO THE GATE Maintenance SAID THAT L #4 SPOILER WAS NOT COMPLETELY HYDRAULICALLY LOCKED OUT. IT WAS ELECTRICALLY AND THE RIGHT SIDE WAS FINE. THE PROB I HAD WAS THE Minimum Equipment List PROC WAS NOT EXPLICIT ON WHAT THEY MEANT BY THE Maintenance DEVICE BEING IN THE 'M' Maintenance POSITION OR THE STATEMENT (UNTIL IT CONTACTS THE 'O' STOP). THERE ARE FIGURES BUT NOTHING SHOWING 'M' POSITION OR 'O' STOP. AT THIS; ALONG WITH OTHERS GATHERED AROUND WE AGREED WHAT THE Minimum Equipment List MEANT AND BY VERIFYING SPOILER LOCK OUT BY THE Flight Crew OP WE FELT WE DID IT PROPERLY. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING Information: THE RPTR STATED THE PROC WAS ACCOMPLISHED PER THE Minimum Equipment List REQUIREMENTS BUT A LOT OF DISCUSSION AND CONCERN WAS EXPRESSED ABOUT WHAT WERE THE 'O' AND 'M' POSITIONS AS NO MARKINGS WERE ON THE ACTUATOR HOUSING. THE RPTR SAID THE PROC TO DEACTIVATE THE SPOILERS WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND THE L AND R SPOILERS REMAINED LOCKED DOWN. THE RPTR STATED THAT ON THE GROUND IN XXX THE DIVERSION STATION THE SPOILERS WERE AGAIN CHKED AND #4 L AND R REMAINED DOWN. THE RPTR REQUESTED CLARIFICATION FOR THE Minimum Equipment List PROCS BE INITIATED. SUPPLEMENTAL Information FROM ACN 509497: Minimum Equipment List'D #4 Flight SPOILER ON L WING EXTENDED IN Flight; UNCOMMANDED. UNABLE TO RETRACT. DECLARED Flight Control EMER AND LANDED XXX; RWY 36L. IT WAS DISCOVERED WHEN A/P ENGAGED; AS Automatic RUDDER TRIM BEGAN TO FUNCTION. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS INCLUDE A RECENT Minimum Equipment List; MECHANICS WHO HAD JUST FINISHED WORKING ON SPOILER PANEL TO Minimum Equipment List IN RETRACTED Position WHO SEEMED CONFUSED BY THEIR PROC. THEY INDICATED THAT THE Minimum Equipment List BOOK HAD POORLY WORDED INSTRUCTIONS. CALLBACK FROM ACN 509497: THE RPTR STATED THE #4 L SPOILER WAS FULLY DEPLOYED AT Flight LEVEL 28000 Feet/Foot WITH NO Flight Control WARNING. THE RPTR SAID AN EMER WAS DECLARED AND DIVERSION WAS MADE TO XXX. THE RPTR STATED XXX TECHNICIANS CHKED THE #4 L AND R Flight SPOILERS ON THE (S,ED AND BOTH REMAINED LOCKED DOWN. THE RPTR STATED THE TECHNICIANS IN <Airport  (Domestic)> COMMENTED ON THE Minimum Equipment List PROCS FOR LOCKING THE SPOILERS DOWN BEING POORLY WORDED."
2,Equipment List,"AT Approximately 110 KTS; RECEIVED WARNING. CONTINUED TKOF AND CONTACTED Maintenance Control AND DISPATCH RECOMMENDED WE RETURN TO PHX. DECLARED AN EMER AND LANDED NORMALLY PHX. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING Information: CREW WAS FLYING AN AIRBUS A320 Aircraft. THEY WERE DISPATCHED WITH AN 'AVIONICS System VERT(LY) Vertical FAULT' Marker WARNING Minimum Equipment List'ED Inoperative. THE AVIONICS RACK HAS AN OUTFLOW VALVE THAT IS FULL OPEN ON THE (S,ED FOR PROPER AVIONICS COOLING. AT LIFTOFF; THE VALVE EITHER PARTIALLY CLOSES OR FULLY CLOSES DEPENDING ON TEMP. THE Aircraft CANNOT PRESSURIZE WITH THIS VALVE FULLY OPEN. THIS VALVE DID NOT CLOSE AS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVING THE Aircraft UNABLE TO PRESSURIZE."
2,Equipment List,Flight ABCD; <Airport  (Domestic)>-CCS; WAS DISPATCHED WITH AN Inoperative THRUST REVERSER CONTRARY TO Minimum Equipment List RESTRS AND I FAILED TO CATCH THE ERROR. WHILE CHKING THE Minimum Equipment List FOR RESTRS DUE TO THE WRITE-UP; I WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE International Civil Aviation Mechanic IN THE COCKPIT PUTTING A PLACARD ON THE REVERSER LIGHT AND MISSED THE LATIN AMERICAN RESTR ON DISPATCH BELOW THE MAIN Minimum Equipment List Information. HAVING CHKED THE RWY LENGTH IN CCS AS WELL AS THE Weather AND RWY LENGTHS AT THE ALTERNATE; I WAS NOT OVERLY CONCERNED WITH THE LOSS OF USE OF ONE REVERSER; AS WE HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED WITH THIS CONDITION ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IN THE PAST. THE Aircraft HAD JUST COME IN FROM CCS; SO I HAD NO REASON TO THINK IT COULD NOT RETURN THERE. MY MISTAKE WAS IN NOT CONTINUING TO GLEAN ALL THE Information FROM THE Minimum Equipment List AFTER THE INTERRUPTION. I DO NOT REMEMBER Intermediate Fix THE Inoperative REVERSER WAS ON THE Flight PLAN; BUT I DO REMEMBER GETTING TO THE COCKPIT AFTER CUSTOMS CLRED THE Aircraft AND REMARKING ABOUT ALL THE PLACARDS IN THE LOGBOOK. I ALSO REMEMBER NOTICING THE SIGN-OFFS IN CCS. IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE DISPATCHER INFORMED ME ON AUG/TUE/01; OF OUR MISTAKE THAT I REALIZED WHAT HAD HAPPENED. AT NO TIME DID I CONSIDER THE CONDITION TO BE OF SERIOUS CONSEQUENCE AND STILL WONDER Intermediate Fix THE RESTR SHOULD BE SELECTIVELY APPLICABLE RATHER THAN GEOGRAPHICALLY BLANKETED. WHY IS A DOMESTIC SHORTER RWY SAFER THAN AN International VERY Longitude RWY. SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT I FAILED TO READ THE ENTIRE Minimum Equipment List ITEM WHICH WOULD HAVE PREVENTED DEPARTING MIA WITH THIS CONDITION.
2,Equipment List,WE HAD AN INCIDENT IN OUR AIRLINE TODAY WHERE WE HAD TO PLACE AN Minimum Equipment List ON AN AIRBUS FOR A FAULTY SKIN AIR OUTLET (EXTRACT) VALVE. I HAD NOT DONE THIS VALVE BEFORE BUT HAD PLACED Minimum Equipment List'S ON SIMILAR VALVES. THIS PROB CAME UP AROUND DEP TIME SO THERE WAS AN ADDED SENSE OF PRESSURE. IN THE Minimum Equipment List BOOK UNDER 21-2604 WE FOLLOWED THE PROCS AND DISPATCHED THE Aircraft; AFTER DEPARTURE THE Aircraft COULD NOT PRESSURIZE AND WROTE SO IN THE LOGBOOK. WE FOUND OUT THAT STEP 5 IN OUR Minimum Equipment List BOOK IS LABELED WRONG. IT SAYS TO TURN THE HANDLE CLOCKWISE UNTIL THE INTERNAL FLAP IS FULLY OPEN. WHERE IN REALITY THE HANDLE MUST BE TURNED COUNTERCLOCKWISE TO CAUSE THIS TO HAPPEN. SO THE FOLLOWING NOTE THAT DESCRIBES THE VALVE MOVEMENT WITH THE HANDLE IN THE NEXT STEP WAS MISINTERPRETED BY US CAUSING THE VALVE TO BE OPEN AND THUS CAUSING THE UNPRESSURIZED CONDITION. WE ARE GETTING TOGETHER WITH OUR TECH CENTER TO MAKE THEM AWARE OF THIS MISPRINT IN THE Minimum Equipment List MANUAL. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING Information: THE RPTR STATED THAT USING THE Minimum Equipment List SPECIAL PROCEDURE FOR RENDERING THE SKIN AIR OUTLET VALVE INOPERATIVE IS NOT CORRECT. THE RPTR SAID STEP 5 IS WRONG AND WILL CAUSE THE CABIN NOT TO PRESSURIZE AS THE VALVE WILL BE OPEN. THE RPTR STATED TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE NEED FOR REVISION.
2,Equipment List,ON JUN/SAT/02; AN Minimum Equipment List PLACARD WAS ISSUED ON Aircraft. Minimum Equipment List #75-3A FOR AN AIRBUS 300 WAS GIVEN FOR A TURBINE ACTIVE Clearance System VERT(LY) Vertical -- HIGH PRESSURE Inoperative. WHEN REVIEWING THE PIREP WHICH WAS A Maintenance ENTRY; I NOTICED THAT THE DISCREPANCY WAS THAT A MANIFOLD WAS DAMAGED ON THE 4H Engine LOW PRESSURE TURBINE CASE COOLING System VERT(LY) Vertical. I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED <Airport  (Domestic)> Maintenance TO CONFIRM THE Maintenance ENTRY WAS FOR THE LOW PRESSURE TURBINE CASE COOLING INSTEAD OF THE HIGH PRESSURE COOLING System VERT(LY) Vertical. THEY ASSURED ME THAT THE ITEM WAS WRITTEN CORRECTLY AND THAT THE PLACARD WAS FOR THE HIGH PRESSURE System VERT(LY) Vertical. I CONFRONTED THE TECHNICIAN SPECIALIST WHO ISSUED THE PLACARD AND PROCEEDED TO CHANGE (CORRECT) THE Minimum Equipment List REF TO READ 75-3B INSTEAD OF 75-3A. IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING AN ACTION TO BE TAKEN ITEM TO CORRECT THE PROB; I NOTICED THAT THE BRACKET WAS REMOVED AND STORED ON THE Information LINE THAT THE International Civil Aviation Mechanic HAD INSERTED TO HELP IN CURING THE PROB. FROM ALL THIS AND AFTER FURTHER REVIEW; A FELLOW TECHNICIAN NOTICED THE HIGH PRESSURE MANIFOLD HAD A HOLE IN IT; WHICH COULD BE REPAIRED AND THAT THE LOW PRESSURE MANIFOLD BRACKET WAS DAMAGED (CRACKED). THE Aircraft WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN OTS FOR REPAIRS AT <Airport  (Domestic)>. THE POINT IS THAT THE WRONG Minimum Equipment List WAS ISSUED BUT CORRECTED AT THAT TIME. THE DAMAGE WAS ON THE HIGH PRESSURE MANIFOLD WHICH HAS BEEN CORRECTED NOW AND THAT THE Aircraft IS OK FOR SVC UNDER THE CORRECT Minimum Equipment List 75-3B WHICH FROM MY OPINION SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SCRUTINIZED BEFORE BEING ISSUED BY MY FELLOW TECHNICIAN BECAUSE NOW IT HOLDS ME RESPONSIBLE; SINCE I CORRECTED THE FIRST ISSUED Minimum Equipment List AND THE ATBT FOR THE PROB.
2,Equipment List,"WHEN I PULLED UP THE Flight PLAN; THERE WAS AN Minimum Equipment List REF TO THE KRUGER FLAP System VERT(LY) Vertical. I BELIEVE IT WAS Minimum Equipment List 27-10. THE TPS WAS LOCKED OUT; AND UPON CALLING DISPATCH; HE INDICATED HE WANTED TO ADVISE ME OF THE V SPD AND WT ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED BY THE Minimum Equipment List. UPON Arrival, Arrive AT THE Aircraft; A LOGBOOK REVIEW INDICATED A KRUGER PROB; AND IT WAS SIGNED OFF DEFERRED IN ACCORD WITH Minimum Equipment List 27-10 STATING THE KRUGER FLAPS WERE DEACTIVATED PER MPM 27-10. THE PLACARD NEAR THE KRUGER LIGHT INDICATED THE KRUGER System VERT(LY) Vertical WAS Inoperative AND THAT THE KRUGER LIGHT WOULD BE ON. DEPARTED <Airport  (Domestic)>; AND THE Aircraft NEEDED AN UNUSUAL; BUT NOT EXTREME; AMOUNT OF AILERON TRIM TO HOLD LEVEL Flight. DURING CRUISE; THE Marker ANNUNCIATED A KRUGER FAULT. THE Marker INDICATED Maximum SPD 300/.65 KRUGER NOT RETRACTED/OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT. FUEL CONSUMPTION INCREASED. AT THIS TIME; THERE WAS NO NOTICEABLE CHANGE IN Flight CHARACTERISTIC THAT WOULD LEAD ONE TO BELIEVE A KRUGER HAD EXTENDED. THE Aircraft WAS DISPATCHED WITH THE KRUGER System VERT(LY) Vertical PLACARDED Inoperative AND WITH THE KRUGER LIGHT ON. THE QUESTION BECAME -- IS THE Marker MESSAGE A VALID INDICATION OF A CHANGE IN THE KRUGER FLAP STATUS OR SOMETHING NORMALLY EXPECTED WITH THE Maintenance PROC THAT TOOK THE KRUGER OTS? THE AILERON TRIM CONDITION MIGHT HAVE BEEN DUE TO AN EXTENDED KRUGER OR IT MIGHT BE DUE TO AN OUT OF RIG AILERON TRIM. NOW; THE Aircraft IS IN CRUISE FLYING 'NORMALLY.' CAN'T SEE THE KRUGERS AND FUEL CONSUMPTION IS NORMAL. ELECTED TO ASK THE QUESTION -- VIA High Frequency PHONE PATCH TO DISPATCH AND TECH -- IS THE Marker INDICATION TO BE EXPECTED WITH A PLACARDED KRUGER System VERT(LY) Vertical. SEEMS WE COULD NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR CERTAIN. VOLUME Sequenced Flashers (Cat  Config); PAGE 22; Flight CTLS; PARAGRAPH 5 'KRUGER LIGHT; AMBER' INDICATES THAT AN Marker MESSAGE WILL BE DISPLAYED ASSOCIATED WITH THE AMBER KRUGER LIGHT. THAT SAME LIGHT THE Minimum Equipment List TELLS ME WILL BE ON. AFTER SOME DISCUSSION WITH Maintenance Control; DISPATCH AND MY First Officer  Heading HDG(S); I ELECTED TO CONTINUE AND EVALUATE FUEL AND OPTIONS AT EACH WAYPOINT. CONTINUING ALLOWED FOR LOWER LNDG WT AND; HENCE; LOWER APCH SPD IN THE EVENT THE TRIM CONDITION WAS A FACTOR. THE Flight PROCEEDED UNEVENTFULLY THEREAFTER TO <Airport (Foreign)>; WHERE I WROTE UP THE OUT-OF-TRIM CONDITION AND THE Marker Information. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING Information: THE RPTR STATED THE TRIM RPT WAS WRITTEN IN THE LOGBOOK AT THE Flight TERMINATION AND THE Maintenance ACTION IS UNKNOWN. THE RPTR SAID IT WAS BELIEVED THE TRIM ACTUALLY WAS AN INDICATION PROB."
2,Equipment List,"DURING PREFLT OF Flight; Maintenance INSISTED ON Minimum Equipment List'ING THE #2 Engine FIRE LIGHT ON THE 'Engine' PANEL. THE INBOUND CREW HAD WRITTEN THE LIGHT UP AS COMING ON INTERMITTENTLY INFLT WITH NO OTHER FIRE INDICATIONS. Engine #2 HAD 3 OTHER Minimum Equipment List'S MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE BLEED System VERT(LY) Vertical. THE Engine #2 FIRE TEST FUNCTIONED NORMALLY ON THE (S,ED; AND TESTED OK VIA THE MCDU; BUT Maintenance WOULD NOT SIGN OFF ON THE FIRE LIGHT CITING A 'System VERT(LY) Vertical' OR 'GNDING PROB.' I TOLD THE Captain THAT I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE FLYING WITH A FIRE LIGHT COMING ON BUT Minimum Equipment List'ED AS 'Inoperative.' THE Captain AND Maintenance BOTH PRESSURED ME TO FLY. I CALLED THE CHIEF (S,'S) Pilot WHO TOLD ME IT WAS OK TO FLY IT. I FEEL STRONGLY THAT Air Carrier Service IMPROPERLY APPLIED A FIRE WARNING LIGHT TO A FIRE DETECTION System VERT(LY) Vertical THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW Following are standard  Encode and Decode terms. OFFICIAL Position ON THIS Minimum Equipment List Intermediate Fix THEY FEEL IT WAS APPLIED CORRECTLY?"
2,Equipment List,Minimum Equipment List WAS ISSUED AGAINST LNDG GEAR WARNING AND DETECTION System VERT(LY) Vertical; 32-4. PROB WAS LNDG GEAR WOULD NOT RETRACT IN #2 Position. Minimum Equipment List WAS ISSUED AT DIRECTION OF B757 TECHNICIAN SVCS SUPVR.
2,Equipment List,Aircraft RELEASED ORIGINALLY WITH Minimum Equipment List (CARGO DOOR OPEN ELECTRICAL System VERT(LY) Vertical). FOUND DOOR CIRCUIT BREAKER PULLED AND COLLARED. RADIO TALKED TO Maintenance Control. THEY SAID IT WAS FINE AND PART OF PROC. 5 MINS LATER; AFTER REREADING Minimum Equipment List; CALLED AGAIN AND ASKED AGAIN Intermediate Fix IT WAS CORRECT SINCE IT WAS NOT IN DOCUMENT. Maintenance Control; A BIT MIFFED AT ME FOR THE CHALLENGE; TRIED TO TELL ME IT WAS THEIR PROC AND REAFFIRMED ALL WAS FINE. WHEN TRYING TO CLOSE CARGO DOORS BY THE Minimum Equipment List PROC; THE System VERT(LY) Vertical WOULD NOT WORK (OBVIOUSLY WITH Control CIRCUIT BREAKER PULLED). I CALLED BACK AND SAID THAT I WANTED Maintenance OUT TO Aircraft TO EITHER DO Minimum Equipment List AS PER BOOK OR TO GIVE DIFFERENT Minimum Equipment List. DURING THE Longitude DELAY; Maintenance TRIED SEVERAL COMBINATIONS WHICH WOULD NOT WORK. EVENTUALLY; THEY HAD TO COMMUNICATE WITH Federal Aviation Administration. (Aircraft HAD BEEN FLYING FOR 2 DAYS LIKE THIS.) Maintenance FINALLY ADDED Minimum Equipment List FOR ELECTRICAL PUMP AND TOLD ME THEY WERE KEEPING OLD Minimum Equipment List. IN FACT; WE WERE FORTUNATE TO OBSERVE THEY CHANGED THE OLD Minimum Equipment List SLIGHTLY AND DID NOT TELL US. AFTER THE NEW Minimum Equipment List; IT WAS 2 LOG PAGES BACK AND HARD TO SEE AS TAGS WERE IN SAME PLACE AND LOOKED SAME. WE DID REQUEST TO DISPATCH Minimum Equipment List CHANGES AND ADDITIONS AND RECEIVED Automatic Communications Addressing & Reporting System AMENDMENTS. HOWEVER; WHEN TAKING THE NEXT LEG OUT WITH SAME Aircraft IN <Airport>; THE OLD Minimum Equipment List WAS ON RELEASE AND NOT THE NEW ADDITION. MY CONCERN IS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ADDED TO RELEASE CORRECTLY AS PER NORMAL PROCS. ALL IN ALL; VERY FRUSTRATING; AND CAUSED A WHOLE PLANE TO MISS CONNECTIONS. IN ADDITION; IT WAS NOT CORRECT FOR THE PREVIOUS 2 DAYS. IN ADDITION; THE PROC FOR A CARGO DOOR OPENING SWITCH ON FOR AIRBUS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AND HAVE SOME PROPER Minimum Equipment List RATHER THAN A COMBINATION THROWN TOGETHER.
2,Equipment List,ON OCT/SAT/03; I WAS TO WORK AN AIRBUS A320. 5 MINS BEFORE DEP I WAS CALLED TO THE Flight DECK FOR AN AVIONICS System VERT(LY) Vertical VENT FAULT. I PERFORMED THE BITE TEST AND FOUND THE SKIN EXTRACT VALVE TO BE AT FAULT. I PROCEEDED TO DEFER THE VALVE PER Minimum Equipment List 21-26-04. WHILE PERFORMING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE Minimum Equipment List; I MISTAKENLY LOCKED OPEN THE MAIN FLAP OF THE EXTRACT VALVE INSTEAD OF THE INTERNAL FLAP OF THE MAIN FLAP. AS A RESULT THE Aircraft GAINED ALT BUT COULD NOT PRESSURIZE RESULTING IN A LNDG AND RETURN TO GATE. HUMAN FACTORS INVOLVED: BESIDES THE Maintenance ACTION ON THE VALVE I ALSO NEEDED TO DO A DEP WALKAROUND AND ASSIST WITH AIR AND AIR START (Inoperative Auxiliary Power Unit). I WASN'T BEING RUSHED BUT WAS A LITTLE OVERWHELMED. I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE Minimum Equipment List PROC. THE OPENING OF THE INTERNAL FLAP IS EXPLAINED CLRLY ON A NOTE ON PAGE 3 OF THE Minimum Equipment List RIGHT BEFORE SECTION B. I OVERLOOKED THIS IMPORTANT NOTE BECAUSE SECTION B IS THE PROC FOR THE OPENING OF THE SKIN EXCHANGE ISOLATION VALVE WHICH IS ALSO PART OF THE Minimum Equipment List. FEELING THAT I HAD COMPLETED THE PROC FOR THE MAIN FLAP I PREMATURELY MOVED ON TO THE ISOLATION VALVE.
2,Equipment List,"30 MI E OF DIDLE DEP; FL180. DEPARTED EWR FOR SJU WITH Equipment EXHAUST VALVE WIRED OPEN PER Minimum Equipment List. UNABLE TO MAINTAIN CABIN ALT AND DIVERTED TO JFK FOR FIX OR ANOTHER Aircraft. Aircraft HAD ARRIVED EWR THE NIGHT BEFORE WITH THIS PROB; BUT WAS NOT FIXED. WE ARRIVED JFK; XB00 Local. THEY HAD ANOTHER Aircraft AVAILABLE ON Arrival, Arrive. IT TOOK 3 HRS FOR THE POWERS THAT BE AT JFK TO DETERMINE THAT WE SHOULD SWITCH Aircraft AND GET THAT Aircraft LOADED AND READY TO GO. THIS ALMOST CAUSED ME TO BE ILLEGAL FOR THE RETURN Flight SJU TO EWR. THE WORK ETHIC AND ATTITUDE AT THE 2 NYC ARPTS I FLY FROM IS DEPLORABLE. SOMEONE NEEDS TO TAKE CHARGE AND MAKE SOME CHANGES OR I SEE COMPANY FOLLOWING THE PATH OF OTHER DEFUNCT ACRS."
2,Equipment List,Aircraft X HAS HAD A HISTORY OF A FALSE #2 BLEED LEAK WHILE ON THE RAMP (NEVER WRITTEN UP AS AN INFLT PROB). Aircraft EXPERIENCED A REPEAT OF THE #2 BLEED LEAK WHILE ON RAMP LOADING FOR Flight. CREW WROTE IT UP. I TRIED TO Clear THE FAULT WITHOUT SUCCESS. Maintenance Controller DECIDED THAT Minimum Equipment List 36-11-01-A (BLEED System VERT(LY) Vertical Inoperative) WOULD BE OK TO DEFER IT UNDER. I FELT IT WAS A FAILURE OF THE LEAK DETECTION System VERT(LY) Vertical. BOTH A&B LOOPS WERE FAULTING. SELECTING A OR B ALONE WOULD NOT TURN OFF THE 'LEAK' LIGHT. THE Minimum Equipment List FOR A OR B LOOPS (Minimum Equipment List 36-22-03) SAYS EITHER -- MAY BE Inoperative; NOT BOTH. THE Minimum Equipment List DOES NOT SAY: 'Intermediate Fix BOTH ARE Inoperative; IT'S OK TO OPERATE WITH THE BLEED System VERT(LY) Vertical Inoperative.' I FEEL THAT THE Aircraft WAS DISPATCHED UNDER THE WRONG Minimum Equipment List AND SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED.
2,Equipment List,"ON TAXI OUT; DURING THE Flight Control Check; THE FOLLOWING Marker MESSAGE APPEARED; 'Flight Control ELAC #1 FAULT.' WE CALLED Maintenance Control AND RAN THROUGH THE PROC IN THE HANDBOOK; CHAPTER X PAGE XX. A RESET OF ELAC #1 WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. THE RESTRS TO Flight WERE NOTED. Maintenance Control ADVISED THAT AN Minimum Equipment List WOULD BE APPLIED UPON Arrival, Arrive IN <Airport  (Domestic)>. THE SPECIFIC Minimum Equipment List WAS NOT PROVIDED. I THEN SPOKE WITH THE DISPATCHER TO ADVISE HIM OF OUR STATUS AND GET HIS INPUT. WE ALL AGREED THAT WE COULD PROCEED TO <Airport  (Domestic)>. THE NON NORMAL PROC FOLLOWED LED US TO BELIEVE WE HAD A COMPUTER FAILURE. WE OPERATED THE Flight AT THE URGING OF Maintenance Control. SINCE WE EXPERIENCED A FAILURE AFTER LEAVING THE GATE AND THAT THIS FAILURE WOULD FALL UNDER THE GUIDELINE OF THE Minimum Equipment List; THE Flight FROM <Airport  (Domestic)> TO <Airport> OCCURRED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER INCIDENCE. Maintenance INSPECTED THE Aircraft UPON Arrival, Arrive IN <Airport> AND DISCOVERED A PROB DIFFERENT THAN A FAILED COMPUTER. I AM NOT SURE THAT THIS FAILURE COULD HAVE BEEN PLACED ON Minimum Equipment List OR NOT. IT SEEMS THAT A BETTER HANDLING OF THE Situation WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HAVE THE SPECIFIC Minimum Equipment List REFED PRIOR TO DEP AND WHATEVER SPECIAL PROCS ACCOMPLISHED PRIOR TO DEP. THEN WE COULD HAVE MADE A MORE INFORMED DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO PROCEED OR RETURN TO THE GATE."
2,Equipment List,"INBOUND Flight CREW WROTE THAT THEY HAD A COCPIT DOOR FAULT LIGHT ON THE Controller; AND THAT THE MIDDLE DOOR Localizer WAS HOT TO THE TOUCH. I CONTACTED OUR Maintenance Control FOR ADVICE. HE GAVE ME AN Minimum Equipment List RELIEF FOR THE WRITE-UP. WHILE PERFORMING THE Minimum Equipment List SPECIAL PROCS THE BUZZER DID NOT SOUND. I CONTACTED Maintenance Controller AGAIN AND HE TOLD ME TO Minimum Equipment List THE BUZZER UNDER ANOTHER Minimum Equipment List. WHEN YOU Minimum Equipment List THE BUZZER YOU NEED TO Minimum Equipment List THE EYPAD Controller ALSO. I PERFORMED THE REQUIRED Minimum Equipment List SPECIAL PROCS ON THESE 2 System VERT(LY) Vertical AND DISPATCHED THE Aircraft. THE OUTBOUND CREW REVIEWED THE Minimum Equipment List'S AND FLEW TO <Airport>. THE FOLLOWING DAY THE Aircraft FLEW THROUGH ANOTHER HUB AND THE OUTBOUND CREW THERE DISPUTED THAT THE Minimum Equipment List WAS NOT PROPERLY USED. THE Aircraft WAS REPAIRED AND TOO A 2 (S,LY) Hour DELAY. A FELLOW International Civil Aviation Mechanic CALLED AND ADVISED THAT HE THOUGHT I USED THE WRONG Minimum Equipment List DUE TO THE FACT THE Minimum Equipment List SPECIAL PROCS FAILED. BUT LIE I SAID PREVIOUSLY Maintenance Controller ADVISED THAT IT WAS O TO Minimum Equipment List THE OTHER System VERT(LY) Vertical. I FELT AT THE TIME IT WAS THE PROPER PROC; BUT AFTER MY CO-WORER BROUGHT IT TO MY ATTN I CAN SEE WHERE IT MAY BE AN IMPROPER Minimum Equipment List."
2,Equipment List,I WAS INSTRUCTED TO REPLACE A DEFIBRILLATOR ON SHIP X. THE ONLY DOCUMENTATION FOR THE REPLACEMENT WAS AN FMR (Flight Maintenance RPT) ITEM SUSPECTING TAMPERING. THE INBOUND CREW KNEW NOTHING OF A FAULT WITH THE DEFIBRILLATOR AND THEY FLEW THE Aircraft FOR 2 Flight LEGS. THE DEFIBRILLATOR IS AN Minimum Equipment List ITEM AND WAS IN SVC FOR AT LEAST 2 Flight LEGS WITH THE BELIEF OF TAMPERING.
2,Equipment List,ON AUG/SUN/04 THE Captain AND DISPATCHER CALLED <Airport> TECHNICIAN ABOUT 2 MELS 30-04B AND 2206A HAVING A CONFLICT. THE Captain SAID THAT Minimum Equipment List 30-04B REQUIRED A Maximum Administration Power TKOF Minimum Equipment List 22-06A THRUST MGMNT System VERT(LY) Vertical INHIBITS THE Engine FROM OVER BOOST AND THAT IT HAD ALREADY HAD 4 OVER-BOOSTS IN THE LOGBOOK AND DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS A GOOD SCENARIO. THE <Airport> TECHNICIAN AGREED. ANTI-ICE VALVE WAS CLOSED AND Flight OPT IN NO ICING. AUG/MON/04 Flight ABCD <Airport>-ZZZ2 I CAME IN AND HAD THE SAME SCENARIO WITH THE VALVE OPEN. I CALLED TECHNICIAN AND GOT NO GUIDANCE OTHER THAN IT WAS LEGAL PER THE Minimum Equipment List. TALKED TO Flight OPS TECHNICIAN. HE AGREED THIS WAS NOT THE BEST OPTION AND WOULD LOOK INTO IT. AUG/XA/04; I STILL DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER.
2,Equipment List,"A PROB WITH THE #2 FUEL FLOW INDICATION WAS DISCOVERED BY Flight CREW; PUT ON Minimum Equipment List; AND LATER TROUBLESHOT BY Maintenance DOWN TO A FUEL FLOW XMITTER. THE PART WAS NOT AVAILABLE AND THE PROB WAS RE-Minimum Equipment List'ED. A PART WAS ORDERED FOR THE Aircraft; BY THE ORIGINAL TROUBLESHOOTING TECHNICIAN. THE PART AND Aircraft ARRIVED AT <Airport  (Domestic)> AND; THEREFORE; THE Minimum Equipment List WAS SCHEDULED BY THE COMPANY TO BE ADDRESSED AND CLRED. THE PART WAS GIVEN TO ME BY ANOTHER TECHNICIAN WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY PICKED UP THE PART AT THE COMPANY-MANNED PART STORAGE AREA. I RESEARCHED AND PRINTED THE APPROPRIATE TASK CARD WHICH GAVE STEP-BY-STEP INSTALLING PROCS. I INSTALLED THE PART ON THE Aircraft. I ACCOMPLISHED THE APPROPRIATE TESTS TO MAKE SURE THE PART FUNCTIONED CORRECTLY IN THE Aircraft; AND TO VERIFY THE Minimum Equipment List COULD BE REMOVED. THE Minimum Equipment List WAS REMOVED. A PAPERWORK ENTRY WAS MADE (COMMONLY REFERRED TO THE ROUTINE OVERNIGHT PAPERWORK PACKAGE). Maintenance Control WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE Minimum Equipment List WAS TO BE REMOVED; AND A COMPUTER ENTRY WAS MADE WHICH OUTLINED THE PROCS AND PART REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION Information. IT WAS LATER DISCOVERED BY THE COMPANY QUALITY ASSURANCE DEPT THAT THE INAPPROPRIATE EFFECTIVITY FOR THE PART WAS INSTALLED. A PART NUMBER 'READ AND RECORD' WAS ISSUED BY THE QUALITY ASSURANCE DEPT; THE PART WAS FOUND BY ANOTHER TECHNICIAN TO BE THE INCORRECT EFFECTIVITY OF PART INSTALLED. THE PART WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED AND THE CORRECT PART WAS INSTALLED. THERE WAS NO RECORD OF INCORRECT INDICATION BY Flight CREW OR Maintenance PERSONNEL. THE PROB WAS CAUSED BY THE ORIGINAL TROUBLESHOOTING TECHNICIAN ORDERING THE INCORRECT PART OF THE Aircraft. THE PROB WAS COMPOUNDED BY THE PART NOT BEING PICKED UP DIRECTLY BY THE INSTALLING TECHNICIAN (MYSELF). THE PROB WAS FURTHER COMPOUNDED BY (S,ED TIME CONSTRAINTS OF THE Aircraft; PERSONNEL STAFFING; AND WORKLOAD ASSIGNED TO THE Maintenance STATION. THE FINAL CAUSE WAS THE NEGLECT OF THE INSTALLING TECHNICIAN (MYSELF) NOT VERIFYING WITH APPROPRIATE COMPANY MANUALS (IPC) THE EFFECTIVITY OF THE Aircraft PART BEING INSTALLED."
2,Equipment List,AT Approximately 20 MINS BEFORE DEP; A RAMP EMPLOYEE BROUGHT A NET FROM THE AFT PIT ON Aircraft X INTO THE READY ROOM AND ASKED Intermediate Fix WE COULD FIX IT. THE FITTING ON THE STANCHION WAS NOT REPAIRED. AFTER SOME SEARCHING IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A NEW FITTING WAS IN IN THE FULL VIEW OF THE WINDOW ON THE DOOR IN THE FOREMAN'S OFFICE WHICH WAS LOCKED. THERE WAS ALSO A SVCABLE STANCHION INSIDE. IT WAS THEN LESS THAN 10 MINS PRIOR TO DEP AND IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT RELIEF WOULD HAVE TO BE SOUGHT THROUGH THE Minimum Equipment List. I PULLED UP THE Minimum Equipment List AND IT WAS NOTED THAT OPS HAD TO BE CALLED. I CALLED THEM AND ASKED Intermediate Fix I COULD Inoperative THE AFFECTED PORTION OR THE WHOLE PIT. THE WAY IT READ IT WAS THE AFFECTED PORTION. SINCE THE OTHER Aircraft ARE DIVIDED INTO INDIVIDUAL COMPARTMENTS; IT SOUNDED REASONABLE TO ME. THAT MEANT THAT THEY COULD STILL USE THE BAGGAGE LOADING System VERT(LY) Vertical WHICH IS SEPARATED FROM THE DOORWAY AND AFT SECTION BY A NET. AFTER THE PLANE HAD PUSHED BACK BUT HAD NOT YET MOVED; STATION OPS CALLED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS DEFERRED PROPERLY (AS FAR AS LOADING THE AFT PIT). I CALLED OPS BACK AND QUESTIONED HIM AGAIN. HE READ IT AGAIN; AND CAME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION THAT I HAD (WE WERE IN CONCURRENCE) AND THE Aircraft WAS ALLOWED TO LEAVE. WHEN I CAME TO WORK THAT NIGHT; I WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE DEFERRAL WAS INCORRECT AND THAT THE PIT SHOULD HAVE REMAINED EMPTY. I FEEL THAT ALL AMBIGUITY SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE Minimum Equipment List. I BELIEVE THE AMBIGUITY COULD BE REMOVED BY CHANGING THE WORD FROM 'AFFECTED' TO 'ENTIRE' FORWARD OR AFT CARGO COMPARTMENT.
2,Equipment List,DURING DEP; Maintenance WAS WORKING AN INBOUND WRITE-UP OF 'SEATS AT XXDEF ROCK ALL 3 SEATS.' THE MECHS SHOWED UP ON THE Aircraft AT Approximately XA30 TO BEGIN THE REPAIR. AFTER WORKING ON THE ISSUE PAST DEP TIME; Maintenance DECIDED TO DEFER THE ITEM AND DEFERRED IT PER Minimum Equipment List; 'SEATS Inoperative; SEATS NOT TO BE OCCUPIED.' SEATS WERE PROPERLY TAPED AND PLACARDED AND PROPER RELEASE AND Minimum Equipment List WERE RECEIVED PRIOR TO PUSHBACK. AFTER ARRIVING IN <Airport>; I WAS INFORMED BY THE ONCOMING Captain THAT OUR DISPATCH WAS ILLEGAL DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE Minimum Equipment List WAS NOT CORRECT. THE SEATS WERE MISSING A FASTENING BOLT TO THE DECK OF THE CABIN; AND; THEREFORE; MUST HAVE BEEN FIXED OR REMOVED PRIOR TO Flight. FACTORS RELATING TO THIS INCIDENT INCLUDE THE FACT THAT MECHS WERE RUSHED DURING WORK ON ITEM; CONFUSION AT Control Center IN THAT THEY DID NOT INITIALLY KNOW WHY THE Flight BOARDING WAS STOPPED DURING THE WORK; AND THOUGHT OUR Aircraft WAS INDEED A DIFFERENT ONE; Flight CREW WAS BEGINNING AN ALL-NIGHTER LEG AND PROPER REST IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE PRIOR TO SUCH LET; Flight WAS EVENTUALLY PAST DEP TIME WHICH AGAIN PROMPTED Maintenance TO BE IN A HURRY.
2,Equipment List,"THE INBOUND Air Carrier Service X EXPERIENCED A SLAT PROB CHANNEL #2. OUR RADIO ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN REQUESTED MY ASSISTANCE IN DEFERRING PROB PER Minimum Equipment List. WE PULLED UP Minimum Equipment List AND BOTH AGREED THAT OUR PROB MATCHED Minimum Equipment List 27-XXX AND PERFORMED TEST AS PRESCRIBED; WHICH RESULTED IN PULLING AND COLLARING CIRCUIT BREAKER. ON Arrival, Arrive OF Flight AT <Airport>; CREW EXPERIENCED CHANNEL 2 FLAPS (CIRCUIT BREAKER OUT). ITEM CHANGED TO Minimum Equipment List 27-XXY. WE FELT WE USED CORRECT Minimum Equipment List AND TEST WAS SATISFACTORY. I HAVE SINCE REVIEWED Minimum Equipment List AND DETERMINED THAT IN FACT WE DID USE WRONG Minimum Equipment List. I FEEL THAT STRESS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DETERMINING FACTOR AS BOTH THE RADIO ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN AND MYSELF HAD BEEN WORKING OUTBOUND Aircraft WHICH WERE HAVING UNUSUAL PROBS; AND WE WERE SHORTHANDED AND WORKING AGAINST THE CLOCK."
2,Equipment List,DURING TAXI FOR TKOF; WE RECEIVED AN Marker WARNING THAT THE #1 AIR CONDITIONING PACK HAD FAULTED. WE ATTEMPTED ONE RESET PER PROCS; BUT IT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. THE Minimum Equipment List PERMITTED CONTINUED Flight WITH SEVERAL RESTRS INCLUDING LIMITING THE CRUISE ALT TO FL310 AND THE NOTATION THAT NO LIVE CARGO COULD BE ON BOARD. WE CALLED OPS ON THE RADIO TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION AS OUR HAZARDOUS CARGO PAPERWORK INCLUDED THE NOTATION THAT LIVE CARGO HAD BEEN LOADED ON THE Aircraft. THE OPS SPECIALIST INFORMED US THAT HE WOULD RECALCULATE OUR Flight PLAN FOR FL310 AND THAT OUR OTHER FREIGHT HAD A HIGHER PRIORITY THAN THE LIVE CARGO SO THAT WE WERE Authority/Authorized TO CONTINUE. I ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE DUTY OFFICER TO DISCUSS OPERATING IN OPPOSITION TO THE Minimum Equipment List. THE DUTY OFFICER THEN CAME ON THE RADIO AND SAID THAT THE LIVE CARGO WAS OF VERY LOW PRIORITY AND THAT WE WERE Authority/Authorized TO CONTINUE THE Flight. I ASKED AGAIN ABOUT OPERATING IN OPPOSITION TO THE Minimum Equipment List AND THE DUTY OFFICER AGAIN ASSURED ME THAT THIS OP WAS Authority/Authorized. WE CONTINUED THE TAXI AT THIS POINT; AND DEPARTED FOR BWI. ONCE AT CRUISE ALT; I PULLED OUT THE Minimum Equipment List AGAIN AND READ THROUGH THE FRONT MATTER WHICH GIVES INSTRUCTIONS ON THE USE OF THE Minimum Equipment List. BY THIS POINT; OF COURSE; I KNEW THAT THE DUTY OFFICER IS NOT EMPOWERED TO Authority/Authorized DEVS FROM THE Minimum Equipment List; BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE. MY DESIRE TO ACCOMPLISH THE MISSION; AIDED BY THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF BOTH THE OPS SPECIALIST AND THE DUTY OFFICER CAUSED ME TO OVERRIDE MY OWN KNOWLEDGE OF Minimum Equipment List USAGE AND TO OPERATE THE TRIP AGAINST THE Minimum Equipment List INSTRUCTIONS. I SHOULD HAVE TAXIED BACK TO THE GATE TO UNLOAD THE LIVE CARGO PRIOR TO DEPARTING. THE CARRIAGE OF LIVE FREIGHT OF THIS NATURE AND FOR THIS CUSTOMER IS RELATIVELY NEW TO OUR OP. THE CUSTOMER HAS INDICATED THAT THEY WILL ACCEPT SOME UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF CARGO LOSS IN THIS CONTRACT; THEREFORE OUR MGMNT HAS INDICATED TO THE PLTS THAT THIS FREIGHT IS OF LOW PRIORITY. HOWEVER; THIS DOES NOT RELIEVE THE PLTS OF THE OVERRIDING RESPONSIBILITY TO OPERATE THE Aircraft IN A LEGAL MANNER. LESSON LEARNED.
2,Equipment List,"ON SAID Flight I WAS GIVEN AN Aircraft WITH JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU COULD HAVE WRONG WITH IT -- BROKEN BRAKES; ANTISKID; WING SPOILERS; HIGH LOADS; SPECIAL ARPT; MOUNTAINS; SPECIAL Engine OUT PROCS; ETC; ETC. IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY MARGINAL DISPATCH; AND ONLY BY MY 10000 HOURS OF EXPERIENCE DID I FEEL THAT IT COULD BE DONE. IT WAS AN EXERCISE IN Minimum Equipment List TWISTING; AND I AM ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT THAT Intermediate Fix THIS IS THE WAY THIS COMPANY IS GOING TO PLAY THE GAME WE WILL SOON BE ON 'CNN;' AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY. I ALSO BELIEVE THE COMPANY IS SAVING MONEY AT THE EXTREME COST OF SAFETY; ESPECIALLY IN THIS CASE. WE'VE TAKEN JUST ABOUT EVERY FACET OF WHAT WE ONCE HAD AS A SAFETY NET AND REDUCED IT TO SAVING 50 CENTS WHERE WE CAN. I AM ABSOLUTELY SURE GIVEN ONE MORE INGREDIENT IN THIS TOXIC SOUP THAT WAS HANDED TO ME THAT DISASTER IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER; IE; A Captain/First Officer  Heading HDG(S) THAT HAS ONLY SEEN A VIDEO A MONTH AGO ONLY WITHOUT THE EXPERTISE OF AN EXPERIENCED Check AIRMAN. YOU TAKE THIS GUY WITH AN Engine FAILURE IN ANY PHASE OF TKOF AND YOU WOULD HAVE....I MEAN 'WOULD HAVE' ENDED UP WITH A DISASTROUS OUTCOME. I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT AFTER 20 YEARS WITH A 100 PERCENT SAFETY FACTOR THAT YOU HAVE SQUEEZED EVERY FACET OF Flight OPS INTO AN EXTREMELY MARGINAL OPERATION BEGGING A TV COVERED EVENT! THIS IS NOT HOW I APPROACH MY JOB; AND I DON'T APPRECIATE IT FROM MY COMPANY; BUT AT LEAST WITH THE FUEL THEY GAVE ME I HAD TO DECLARE MINIMUM FUEL ON Arrival, Arrive IN MIA AND DISPATCH HAD TO REQUEST HELP FROM MIA Air Traffic Control. THIS WAS ALSO DISCUSSED WITH DISPATCH PRIOR TO MY DEP. IT'S ALMOST LIKE A CONTEST TO SEE HOW FAR WE CAN SPREAD THIS COMPANY THIN; AND WHEN AN ACCIDENT HAPPENS; WE'LL START REINTRODUCING THE SAFETY ELEMENTS WE ONCE HAD. CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL WHO GOT US TO THIS POINT.SUPPLEMENTAL Information FROM 723251: Flight WAS TO BE OPERATED WITH THE #7 BRAKE; GREEN ANTISKID AND SPOILERS 1 AND 4 Inoperative. THE MELS FOR THESE ITEMS REFER TO EACH OTHER AND IS POORLY WORDED. 'SPOILER CONTROL SYSTEM' IN Minimum Equipment List 32-06 IS NOT DEFINED IN THE Outer Marker. WITH ANTISKID Inoperative -- (S,ED SPOILERS MUST BE OPERATIVE. HOW MANY PANELS? TOO MANY QUESTIONS ARISE. I BELIEVE WE WERE LEGAL TO DEPART; BUT AN ARGUMENT MAY BE MADE FOR BEING ILLEGAL."
2,Equipment List,AFTER GATE DEP WE RECEIVED A SEC 1 FAULT Marker. I ELECTED TO TAXI TO THE 'A' DEICE PAD TO ATTEMPT A RESET Coordination  Alerting System WITH Maintenance. ALL RESET ATTEMPTS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL AND WE RETURNED TO ANOTHER GATE TO HAVE Maintenance Minimum Equipment List THE ITEM. THE Minimum Equipment List IS FRAGMENTED; POORLY WRITTEN AND REQUIRES FOLLOW-UP PROCS BEFORE EACH Flight BUT IS NOT PUBLISHED AS AN 'FR.' FOLLOW-UP PROCS INCLUDE: 1) CHKING BOTH SIDE STICK TRANSDUCERS OPERATING BEFORE EACH Flight (OUR TRAINING NEVER COVERED EXACTLY WHAT A SIDE STICK TRANSDUCER IS). 2) PRESSURIZING AND DEPRESSURIZING VARIOUS Hydraulic System VERT(LY) Vertical BY USE OF THE OVERHEAD Maintenance PANEL (ALTHOUGH NOT AN OFFICIAL COMPANY POLICY; OUR TRAINING WAS; 'THAT'S A Maintenance PANEL; YOU GUYS SHOULD NEVER TOUCH THAT PANEL'). 3) NO USE OF SPEED BRAKES IN Flight. 4) CHKING ELECTRICAL System VERT(LY) Vertical NORMALITY INCLUDING THRUST REVERSER OP. 5) ASSURING ALL PERFORMANCE PENALTIES HAVE BEEN APPLIED (THIS IS MY BIGGEST PROB). AFTER Maintenance COMPLETED THE Minimum Equipment List PROCS; WE RECEIVED AN AMENDED RELEASE FOR Minimum Equipment List ADDED AND NEW RELEASE TIME. THE RELEASE STATED AS AN 'FR' SHOULD BE A Maintenance AND NOT AN OPS PROC AND THE Maximum THRUST REQUIREMENT SHOULD BE PUBLISHED IN THE PROVISO SECTION. THE Minimum Equipment List SHOULD BE PUBLISHED AS AN 'FR.' SHOULD BE A Maintenance AND NOT AN OPS PROCS. Maximum THRUST REQUIREMENT SHOULD BE PUBLISHED IN THE PROVISO SECTION.

GET Maintenance Control OPS TO MAKE THE Maintenance Control Position LESS STRESSFUL AND EASIER TO WORK WITH. THE DESIGNERS OF THE PROCESSES FOR Maintenance Control NEVER ASKED A Maintenance Control TECHNICIAN HOW THE JOB IS DONE. IT DELAYS THE OP AND IS CONFUSING. THIS IS A FRONT LINE Position THAT DIRECTLY IMPACTS THE OP AND HAS BECOME STRESSFUL TO THE EMPLOYEES."
2,Equipment List,I RELEASED A Flight WITH A NO-GO Minimum Equipment List FOR THE MEGAPHONE. IT STATES IN THE Minimum Equipment List MANUAL THAT THERE ARE 2 INSTALLED AND 2 REQUIRED FOR DISPATCH. THE Captain AND First Officer  Heading HDG(S) ALSO MISSED IT. THE Minimum Equipment List ALSO STATED THAT IT CAN BE APPLIED Intermediate Fix ONLY BAGGAGE AND CARGO ARE CARRIED. I WILL REMEMBER THIS Minimum Equipment List. BOTH THE Captain AND DISPATCHER DID NOT REALIZE THAT THERE WERE 2 MEGAPHONES REQUIRED FOR DISPATCH.
2,Equipment List,I HAD 3 Aircraft AND 6 MECHS. Aircraft CAME IN WITH A WRITE-UP 'CABIN PRESSURE System VERT(LY) Vertical #1 AND #2 FAULT' Marker MESSAGE. THE Minimum Equipment List ON THE Aircraft READ AUTOMATIC CABIN PRESSURE Control System VERT(LY) Vertical #1 Inoperative. I CALLED Maintenance Control TO ALERT THEM THAT WE HAD A PROB WITH THE PRESSURIZATION System VERT(LY) Vertical. I THEN TOLD MY SUPVR WE MIGHT NEED AN OUTFLOW VALVE. SUPVR STARTED THE PROCESS OF ACQUIRING ONE BECAUSE THE REDEYE WOULD BE HERE IN TIME TO CHANGE THE VALVE AND TAKE AS SMALL OF A DELAY AS POSSIBLE. I THINK THAT'S WHEN OUR FOCUS WENT TO THE OUTFLOW VALVE. WE HAD TO PROVE THE VALVE WOULD BE THE FIX. THE AMM PB04 CHKED GOOD; CHKED Minimum Equipment List CONDITION B; ALL CHKED GOOD. COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROB OR FIND ANY FAULTS. I DO NOT KNOW WHO DECIDED NOT TO CHANGE THE VALVE KNOWING IT WAS ON THE WAY. Between THE DISTRS OF DEALING WITH 2 OTHER PLANES AND HELPING THE 4 OTHER GUYS WITH RATHER MINOR PROBS. THE FOCUS BEING ON THE VALVE WHEN IT GOT TO CRUNCH TIME AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO SAID IT WENT SOMETHING LIKE; 'WHAT'S THE PROB? IT'S ON Minimum Equipment List JUST SAY System VERT(LY) Vertical ON Minimum Equipment List; Aircraft TO CONTINUE ON Minimum Equipment List; DEFER OUTFLOW VALVE.' REMEMBER THE DUTY Manager; Maintenance Control WAS CONTACTED SEVERAL TIMES AND WAS UP TO SPD AS THINGS PROGRESSED. MY SUPVR AND WHOEVER CANCELED THE JOB REQUEST AND MY WILLINGNESS TO FALL FOR THE OLD 'WHAT'S THE PROB?' ARE THE REASONS FOR THIS ERROR. NEXT STATION CHANGED OUTFLOW VALVE. SPOKE TO SUPVR REGARDING SITUATION AND FUTURE PLAN OF ACTION. Interpretation  Medium Intensity Approach OF THE PROB STATED; COUPLED WITH DISTRS; MISINFO. I MUST NOT BE PRESSURED TO HURRY FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING Flight TIMES. I MUST CONSIDER THE SOURCES FROM WHOM I ASK FOR HELP. DOUBLECHK EVERY POSSIBLE CHANCE OF Interpretation  Medium Intensity Approach OF THE Minimum Equipment List/CDL BOOKS. WHEN I FEEL UNEASY ABOUT THINGS; TAKE A STEP BACK AND RETHINK AND GIVE IT TO MY SUPVR TO SIGN OFF.
2,Equipment List,WORKING AS A Maintenance Controller ON NOV/XA/08; I RECEIVED A CALL FROM AN AIRLINE International Civil Aviation Mechanic WHO COMPLETED HIS ASSIGNED Check ON Aircraft. HE FOUND 1 PORTABLE HALON FIRE EXTINGUISHER TO BE OUT OF DATE (SVCABLE TIME LIMIT EXPIRED). AFTER REVIEWING THE Minimum Equipment List I FELT THE Aircraft COULD BE LEGALLY DISPATCHED UNDER Minimum Equipment List 26-26. THIS STATES THAT 4 PORTABLE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS ARE REQUIRED FOR DISPATCH: 1 ON THE Flight DECK; 3 IN THE Passenger COMPARTMENT; 2 OF WHICH MUST BE HALON; 1 MUST BE H2O. I ASKED THE International Civil Aviation Mechanic Intermediate Fix WE MET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE Minimum Equipment List. AT THAT TIME HE SAID WE DID AND I ISSUED THE Minimum Equipment List FOR HAVING 1 PORTABLE FIRE EXTINGUISHER MISSING/UNSVCABLE. ON NOV/XA/08 NIGHT AT Approximately XA50; I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE OUTBOUND Flight CREW AND DISPATCHER ASSIGNED TO Aircraft X PREPARING TO DEPART FROM <Airport  (Domestic)>. THEY WERE QUESTIONING THE USE OF Minimum Equipment List 26-26-24A FOR THIS Aircraft. THE Flight CREW EXPLAINED THAT THIS SERIES OF AIRBUS Aircraft DO NOT HAVE AN H2O PORTABLE FIRE EXTINGUISHER ON BOARD. THE CABIN CREW (Flight ATTENDANTS ASSIGNED TO THE Flight) LOOKED FOR AND COULD NOT FIND AN H20 PORTABLE FIRE EXTINGUISHER THUS NOTIFYING THE Pilot In Command. I THEN REFERENCED THE Check JOB CARD; KNOWING THAT THE EMER Equipment IS CHKED ONCE A Week TO CONFIRM THE EXPIRATION DATE AND CONTENT OF THE CABIN EMER Equipment. THIS IS WHERE I VERIFIED THE Captain'S CONCERN THAT AN H20 PORTABLE FIRE EXTINGUISHER IS NOT INSTALLED ON THIS SERIES OF AIRBUS Aircraft. AT THAT POINT I CONTACTED Maintenance AND ASKED THEM TO Check STOCK FOR A PORTABLE HALON FIRE EXTINGUISHER. THEY HAD THE ONE IN STOCK THAT WAS REQUIRED FOR THAT SERIES OF Aircraft. IT WAS INSTALLED; IN PLACE OF THE MISSING UNIT AND THE Minimum Equipment List CLEARED. THE Aircraft WAS THEN RELEASED FOR Flight WITHIN 20 MINS OF ITS SCHEDULED DEP TIME FROM <Airport  (Domestic)>. THIS MAY HAVE BEEN PREVENTED BY INCLUDING A NOTE TO RESTRICT THE Minimum Equipment List OR BY REQUIRING THE SAME FLEET TYPES TO CARRY THE SAME EMER Equipment ON BOARD. AT THIS TIME OUR MECHS SEE A MIX SERIES OF THE SAME FLEET TYPE OF AIRBUS Aircraft AT ANY GIVEN NIGHT. A MISTAKE LIKE THIS; EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE A COMPLACENT ERROR; IS EASILY MADE GIVEN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.
2,Equipment List,Upon arrival at XA15; found a message on Lead's desk. Dayshift Lead stated that aircraft would arrive in need of Minimum Equipment List upon arrival per Maintenance Controller. Aircraft was to arrive at XA28. Meanwhile; I was receiving turnover information on Aircraft Y which had a left engine HPTCC replacement in progress of which required my attention. I then received a phone call from Maintenance Controller explaining that Aircraft X would need an Minimum Equipment List placed on it upon its arrival. I stated to Maintenance Controller that I would call him to apply the Minimum Equipment List when I got the chance to meet the aircraft. I then went out on the ramp to review the status of Aircraft Y. When I was briefed of the status of the valve change; I then proceeded to Aircraft X to find the Aircraft being loaded with passengers. At this time I worked my way to the flight deck and spoke with the Captain. I informed him that we would apply the Minimum Equipment List since this was a previous problem he had on this aircraft. At this point I grabbed the logbook and worked my way back out to the jetway phone and commenced communications with Maintenance Control. Maintenance Controller and I began the process of MELing the aircraft. I was relying on his input as I did not have the Minimum Equipment List book in front of me. He guided me through the installation of the Minimum Equipment List #26-12-01b; and the verbiage to be written underneath of the Minimum Equipment List. I asked if there were any special procedures required by Maintenance and there were none. Never in our conversation did we exchange whether it was a follow-up or not. So I assumed it was a different placard not requiring a follow-up. Please note that I was made aware of the Minimum Equipment List infraction later in 2008 by the Manager. Replaced placard from the other to orange. The event occurred due to time constraints and the inability to review and verify the proper application of the Minimum Equipment List. My reliance on the information led to the application of the wrong placard. In the future; the Minimum Equipment List book will also be removed from the cockpit and reviewed prior to acceptance and application of Minimum Equipment List. Callback conversation with Reporter revealed the following information: Reporter stated the orange placard would alert the flight and maintenance crews of an Minimum Equipment List deferral and the requirement for an additional procedure to be followed. The additional procedure would require some kind of action to be accomplished by Operations (flight crew); maintenance or both. In his case; one of the fire loops on #2 engine was deferred but required the pilot to perform a fire loop test on the A319 prior to each flight. With the incorrect colored placard installed; the preflight fire loop test may not have been performed on following flights. The orange placard was later installed.
2,Equipment List,Pushed off gate for flight; after second engine start SEC 1 fault. Contacted Maintenance Control and could not resolve the issue.  Taxied Back to gate for Maintenance to fix. Minimum Equipment List 27-94-01 SEC 1 fault; as well as 22-99-01 down grade Clear Air Turbulence  System I. Gate Agent needed the gate and closed the door 2 times before everything was done. Crew had to complete a long checklist and could not get through it in time. Maintenance person collared ELAC 1 instead of SEC 1. Finally fixed the problem and we were ready to go. We were thinking about takeoff performance and new numbers with dispatch; since we had some inoperative spoilers. After takeoff Marker FCTL SEC 1 fault circuit breaker tripped on overhead panel. Tripped R ELEC Bay. Speed brakes Inoperative landing distance procedures apply; at 10000 feet. Climb checklist packs only 1.  Pulled out the Minimum Equipment List book found in Minimum Equipment List 21-52-01 packs item speed brakes must operate normally. Leveled at FL340 called Maintenance Control and said I don't believe we should be up here. They said we were good to FL370. We told them to read the Minimum Equipment List. We then said we have an extra 7.3 on the gas and if weather is good we would like to fly at a lower alt. We then requested FL280. We felt this was good and we landed with 5.0. Put in the Minimum Equipment List 27-94-01 not with one pack.  If we had the SEC 1 problem first then the pac fault we would have caught it.
2,Equipment List,After reviewing the two Minimum Equipment List's on the aircraft for our flight I decided that the combination of both was not acceptable.  Having an air condition pack inoperative and the left wing air leak detection system B loop inoperable; although legal as separate Minimum Equipment List's; the combination was not the best for flight safety.  At that time; I requested a plane change and brought it to the attention of the acting Chief Pilot and the Dispatcher. None had the authority to switch aircraft.  Rather than fix the aircraft or switch to another; they switched crews.
2,Equipment List,Minimum Equipment List 34-41a; Minimum Equipment List 34-41b request Weather Radar circuit breaker to be pulled before flight. However; when the C/B is tripped and collared; about five seconds later the Terrain fault light illuminates in the overhead Terrain switch.  The Minimum Equipment List does not direct Maintenance to address this 'induced' light fault.  Neither does the Minimum Equipment List inform the flight crew in their operations placard on the Maintenance Release that there will be a Terrain fault displayed.  The Terrain function is truly faulted at this time because there is no response to any preflight requests by the crew or (Centralized Fault Display System) CFDS test by Maintenance.  This same flight deck effect happened on another A320 and was simulated on two other A320s.
2,Equipment List,[I] rescheduled onto a late flight and an airplane change. Entered cockpit and mechanic handed me logbook and told me I was good to go. Maintenance Control had applied Minimum Equipment List 27-93-01B ELAC #1 inoperative [a] very complicated Minimum Equipment List with operational procedures. [I] called Dispatch and Maintenance Control. Write-up was a flight control issue on previous flight - I was very uncomfortable from the start with this. Dispatch had sent an amended release with new Minimum Equipment List. During the discussion with Maintenance and Dispatch; I learned that this was a revised/temporary Minimum Equipment List and the paperwork should have shown a '*T' to inform me of a revision. Dispatch sent a new amended release by Automatic Communications Addressing & Reporting System; and I informed Maintenance Control to send a mechanic with the new revised Minimum Equipment List. The current Minimum Equipment List book in the aircraft did not have a condition B. When mechanic showed up with revised paperwork; we could not determine if the revised procedures were used when the original mechanic applied the Minimum Equipment List - the original mechanic had gone home. I told the mechanic that we needed to start over. We needed to ensure that the new revised procedures had been properly completed and complied with. From start to finish; it was over an hour before all procedures and paperwork was completed and I could accept the aircraft. The aircraft had a history - this was the third ELAC write-up in 16 days. This came about because:1. New Minimum Equipment List procedures are way too complicated - too easy to miss something or make honest mistake. 2. Not advised properly of the revised Minimum Equipment List (condition B) *T.3. 4 pages of Minimum Equipment List procedures - way too much and too complicated - took over an hour to accomplish.4. Little to no info given to flight crew on the maintenance procedure. This is a flight control issue; and crew needs more information to determine safety of flight.5. 3rd write-up in 16 days - company should have been more proactive in troubleshooting issue.6. A complicated operations procedure for flight crew to accomplish - procedure had little explanation of the purpose of the procedure (what exactly are we checking?) Condition B states to complete condition A procedures - too easy to miss. Condition B should state the procedures to follow on its own.7. took too long to accomplish all items - over 1 hour to apply and evaluate Minimum Equipment List.8. Too little information given to the flight crew. New 'culture' in training to minimize pilot's handbook; makes research and ability to find information easily difficult in real world line ops. 9. Almost no information given to flight crew on maintenance procedure - had to review Maintenance Control procedure with mechanic with info from the maintenance manual.10. Complicated operations procedure to be complied with prior to each departure did not require an 'orange' placard.The new Minimum Equipment List system is almost non-workable in complicated instances like this. It is too hard to follow; and allows the opportunity for too many mistakes to be made - honest mistakes that may affect safety of flight. The fact that this took over 1 hour reflects the complexity of this Minimum Equipment List and its application; in addition to the understanding of it by the flight crew and mechanic. Procedures failed as flight crew was not properly notified of the temporary revision - this could have been a huge factor in this case. Because the system is so complicated - it was not immediately found by the crew. In fact; there is no way for the crew to know; unless the procedures are followed and Maintenance and the Dispatcher properly advise the crew. Over and over in this case; I had to search for information from multiple sources - complicated. Needed to devote all attention to this complicated Minimum Equipment List - but since flight were now delayed - constant interruptions - which opened the door to possibility of mistakes. As a line pilot; I do not like this Minimum Equipment List system. It is difficult to use; hard to understand; and many times; requires several readings of the procedure for even a minimal understanding of what is required.Note: since this new Minimum Equipment List system was implemented - have found numerous mistakes in Minimum Equipment List applications when picking up new aircraft or having Minimum Equipment List's applied. Incorrect Minimum Equipment List conditions; incorrect placards; etc. It is not people not doing their job - it is because the system is so complicated and hard to understand; that it is hard to apply correctly; and hard to ensure that Minimum Equipment List's have been applied correctly. My suggestion-return to the old system - or completely rewrite this system.
2,Equipment List,Arriving at the aircraft; the incoming crew was waiting on the ramp for the bus we arrived in. We spoke to the Captain and one of the First Officer. They told us of the Minimum Equipment List (27-25-02) which was on the aircraft. They stated they had received the warning associated with the discrepancy on final. In hindsight; this should have been written up as the requirement of the Minimum Equipment List: 'Condition A May be inoperative provided before each flight; and for each inoperative caution; rudder deflection is checked operative using only the servo control associated with each inoperative caution.' [This] cannot be complied with in such a case. Additionally; this Minimum Equipment List is as setup for serious unintended consequences. We performed the required check at the gate before leaving. I really felt uncomfortable with this Minimum Equipment List because of the seriousness of the rudder jamming in flight with no recourse. Upon taxi out; we were just going straight on the taxiway and the warning occurred. So; we performed the check. When you turn off the Green and Yellow Hydraulic Systems to check the B; you get a number of bells and chimes; the aircraft goes into Alternate Law. After restoring the systems everything appeared to return to normal. Being uncomfortable; we returned to the gate only to be told by Maintenance Control the condition was as expect there was only a bad switch; etc. This is an unacceptable Minimum Equipment List because the crew cannot comply with the 'Condition A' requirement in flight as happened to the crew of another aircraft. Also; putting the aircraft in Alternate Law by de-powering the other two systems is; at least; a bad idea as it quite possibly could have unintended consequences. Additionally; there is no specific guidance on which exact switches to utilize to properly de-power the hydraulic systems could easily have been a problem. We were fortunate to have a check airman on the International Reserve Officer seat so that was less challenging. By the way; this was something like the eleventh day of the Minimum Equipment List! So; probably twenty something crews took it across the ocean; including us!
2,Equipment List,AVNCS System VERT(LY) Vertical FAULT [message] displayed on UPPER Marker. Chronic Issue. Tried to implement Minimum Equipment List 21-26E; Deactivate Isolation (Iso) Valve. The Iso Valve (24HQ) needs to be placed in the 'Open' position. But the Minimum Equipment List 21-26E does not tell the Aircraft Maintenance Technician (AMT) to 'Remove' the cannon plug from the Iso Valve (24HQ).  The Avionics Equipment Ventilation Computer (AEVC) Test must be accomplished before each flight and the override switch in the flight deck selected; this would move the Iso Valve to 'Open'.  Per Maintenance Manual (MM) 21-26-00; Deactivation of Iso Valve (24HQ) does not match Minimum Equipment List 21-26E.
2,Equipment List,Conflicting Minimum Equipment List items were discovered by Maintenance Control when a Fuel Boost Pump was determined defective and the MELs for Actual Time Of Arrival Chapter-28 does not allow for FUEL QTY and Auto Fuel Feed MELs' existing discrepancies [at the same time]. These two sub Actual Time Of Arrival items conflict due to crew procedures. Aircraft was removed from service immediately and is being worked to correct all discrepancies. Chain of Events: 1) September 2011 - Left outer Fuel Quantity Indication on Minimum Equipment List.  Requires entries after each fueling for Maintenance action verification of fuel quantity contained in the fuel tank after each refueling. Fuel tank quantity verified per Minimum Equipment List Procedures after each fueling.2) October 2011 a new discrepancy was entered in the logbook by Flight Crew for 'DURING CRUISE Marker WARNING CENTER TANKS EMPTY AND CGCC (Center of Gravity Control Computer) FAILED TO SWITCH TO INNER TANKS. Maintenance at arriving station called Maintenance Controller # 1 for Minimum Equipment List for CGCC - inoperative (Inoperative). This aircraft model does not have a Trim Tank installed and no CGCC Computer/System is applicable.  An Minimum Equipment List was issued by Maintenance Controller # 1 for the CGCC 'Inoperative'.3) October 2011; Maintenance Controller # 2 (Me); reviewed the item independently of the [aircraft] history screen and seen the CGCC Minimum Equipment List added to a NON-CGCC equipped aircraft; I called the deferring station Lead and had the discrepancy cleared for the CGCC Minimum Equipment List and opened a new Write-up and referenced the original discrepancy for 'DURING CRUISE Marker WARNING CENTER TANKS EMPTY AND CGCC FAILED TO SWITCH TO INNER TANKS'; then deferred the Auto Fuel Feed System.4) The Auto Fuel Feed Minimum Equipment List was added. This Minimum Equipment List has a reminder message in place for Maintenance Control to view when a Minimum Equipment List or series of Minimum Equipment List's may conflict with operational or other system discrepancies per the Minimum Equipment List. The flash message was displayed for the Auto Fuel Feed Minimum Equipment List to NOT be applied when Marker Fuel Quantity Indication MELS are; or discrepancies are also displayed. I overlooked and overrode the flash message and added the Auto Fuel Feed Minimum Equipment List after the Left Outer Fuel Quantity Indication system was previously open [deferred] on the logbook.[Perform] additional review of open Minimum Equipment List items and current defects that may be Minimum Equipment List'd provided the provisos allow for the multiple sub-system Minimum Equipment List(s) to be applied.  Added additional information to Minimum Equipment List statements in computer. Add note to company Minimum Equipment List book to add conflicts with Auto Fuel Feed vs Fuel Quantity System defects.  Factors affecting the quality of human performance: A) being in a hurry.  B) Not fully reading a Minimum Equipment List/Maintenance Note.
2,Equipment List,During the boarding processes we received an avionics vent fault Marker message. It was twenty minutes before departure and we put the discrepancy in the Log and called Maintenance. Maintenance was quick to respond and mentioned that this particular aircraft had this fault ten times in the last thirty days. The mechanics decided to Minimum Equipment List the system; and signed the log after completing the follow up procedure. We took off about one and a half hours late. During climb through 6;000 Feet/Foot; we received an Marker status message not to exceed 10;000 Feet/Foot in the climb. We notified Maintenance and also sent an Automatic Communications Addressing & Reporting System message to our Dispatcher and returned to the field for an overweight landing at 143;600 LBS. The sink rate at touchdown was 200 Feet/Foot per minute. Maintenance said they would have the Minimum Equipment List corrected and we would soon be on our way. I spoke via phone with the assistant Chief Pilot and with his approval; I decided to get another aircraft. We departed and the trip was uneventful. Maintenance improperly applied the Minimum Equipment List.
2,Equipment List,I was assigned the task by my Lead to replace the Fuel Control and Monitoring Computer (FCMC-2) on an A330 aircraft due to [discrepancy] history. The aircraft was scheduled for Routine Over-Night (RON) maintenance and a work [paper] package was assigned. An Minimum Equipment List was written against the [horizontal stabilizer] trim tank inlet valve; but I wasn't aware that this was partly due to the FCMC. A [previous] Minimum Equipment List maintenance procedure (MP) to place [install] the trim tank inlet valve actuator locking plate was not reversed [removed] and a 'dummy' plug was not removed.There wasn't any indication that the [Minimum Equipment List] maintenance procedure had been complied with and the [FCMC] system tested OK. Another Aviation Maintenance Technician (AMT) that was more familiar with the pre-merger paperwork for that aircraft informed me that the item was written against an Minimum Equipment List. I did not see any Minimum Equipment List that involved the FCMC; but he told me that the Minimum Equipment List that was on the aircraft needed to be cleared since I changed out the FCMC. I cleared the Minimum Equipment List. I think what caused the problem was lack of clarity on what needed to be done and why; clarity on handling work packages; and also reading through the Minimum Equipment List. To prevent this from happening again I need to review the Minimum Equipment List maintenance procedures more closely. I corrected the situation by replacing the actuator and removing the locking plate and the dummy plug.
2,Equipment List,When I arrived at our jet I found an Minimum Equipment List on the log book relating to a write up we had made on this aircraft when we brought it in the night before. That write up described an indication on the hydraulic Marker page that indicated a failed or faulty pressure switch or related cannon plug downstream from the Blue electric hydraulic pump. My past experiences with this specific write up has caused me numerous disagreements with Maintenance Control with regards to whether or not a suitable Minimum Equipment List exists for this condition. Those past experiences only reinforced my interpretation that the Minimum Equipment List does not address this specific condition; and it is therefore not 'Minimum Equipment List'able. When the condition was discovered the night before; I entered it and another discrepancy into the logbook and called Maintenance Control and relayed the info regarding both. I made clear to him that it was my interpretation of the MELs that the hydraulic issue must be fixed; as it was not 'Minimum Equipment List'able. I assumed; wrongly; that with the aircraft overnighting with ample Maintenance staff on duty the issue would be correctly addressed. Unfortunately; upon arriving the next morning I found the inappropriate Minimum Equipment List applied to the write-up.I called Maintenance Control and explained that their Minimum Equipment List did not address the indication; instead it addressed the label; an entirely different indication. We went back and forth; with him stating that Airbus had put out some kind of an engineering statement years ago that supposedly addressed this indication and that we were 'good to go'. I replied that I had; in fact; read such a report years before and it was determined to NOT address this condition. I acknowledged that there may in fact be another report and I would be very eager to read it as I was looking for some way to LEGALLY fly this airplane with its passengers to their destination. After considerable discussion he acknowledged that the applied Minimum Equipment List was in fact incorrect; and he now wanted to apply the same Minimum Equipment List number; but with a new condition. The new proposed condition was for the electric pump indication. I pointed out that too was incorrect; as the pump indicated properly and the failed switch was downstream of the pump. I repeatedly stressed that I did not consider this a safety issue; but rather a legal one; as it was simply a poorly written Minimum Equipment List that did not adequately address all the potential Marker indications.After significant additional dialog back and forth without a mutually agreeable solution I had no choice but to call Maintenance Control and refuse the Minimum Equipment List and; if it remained on the logbook; refuse the aircraft as well. I called Dispatch and explained the situation and was transferred to the Maintenance Representative there. I relayed to him the disagreement with Maintenance Control and explained my pained position. He listened and said he'd get back to me. A short time later I learned that the flight had been put on an extended delay and a repair would be made. The delay extended into late afternoon when we finally departed. Simply put; this specific failure provides only 2 options. The first; FIX the aircraft and proceed with schedule. Second; if fix isn't possible at current station within a reasonable period of time; as determined by Maintenance Control and Dispatch; then maintenance ferry the aircraft to a station where repairs can be accomplished. The third option Maintenance Control tried to apply is NOT acceptable. One cannot twist an existing Minimum Equipment List to fit a scenario where it doesn't properly apply; as I believe was the case here. The fix is very simple; modify the MELs to address this specific situation. Until this occurs; Maintenance will not be able to avail itself of the very simple and reasonable process of applying a LEGAL and safe Minimum Equipment List to this relatively innocuous situation. Oh; and ensure MOC understands and respects the limits of the MELs; and proceeds accordingly.
2,Equipment List,I was coming back from a canceled tow; when Dayshift Lead told me to stop by [another Gate] and help out Mechanic Y on an [aircraft] return to gate call. I printed out Minimum Equipment List 21- 26-04 and we went thru it together. When I went thru the process of opening skin air outlet valve per Minimum Equipment List 21-26-04 I got confused with the instructions provided. Minimum Equipment List Figure-A does not differentiate the [outlet valve] main door from the auxiliary door and internal valve doors. This picture only shows the handle; the On/Off switch and auxiliary flap (which appears to be pointing at whole door). Also instructions are a little confusing. So I made the mistake of partially opening the main flap instead of the auxiliary flap. Then I proceeded to finish the rest of the maintenance Minimum Equipment List procedure. I asked Mechanic Y to take a look at the Minimum Equipment List procedure and told him what I had done. He agreed that the Minimum Equipment List was confusing and agreed with what I had done. Then Mechanic Y did an Avionics Equipment Ventilation Computer (AEVC) Test and finished paperwork. We heard on the radio that the airplane was coming back to the gate. Air turn back [due to] avionics outlet skin air valve main door was not fully closed; [causing] an avionics vent fault.Then Mechanic Y and I did more research involving Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) 21-26-00 and Task 21-26-00-040-002 that made it very clear on position required of main/auxiliary [outlet valve] flaps and Deactivation Procedure. We re-accomplished Deactivation Procedure in accordance with Minimum Equipment List and AMM 21-26-00 and Task 21-26-00-040-002; re-accomplished the Avionics Equipment Ventilation Computer (AEVC) Test and paperwork. Suggest better labeling of figures/drawings and procedures in Minimum Equipment List 21-26-04 and more classroom/hands-on training.
2,Equipment List,An aircraft was on delay for a maintenance discrepancy on another gate; that aircraft was subsequently taken out of service. Another aircraft was used as a replacement for this flight. The replacement aircraft was moved from the east auxiliary pad to the gate on short notice so the flight could dispatch. At departure time; the flight crew notified Maintenance that they had a malfunction with the Engine Fire Detection System. I arrived at the aircraft to assess the situation. I determined after some preliminary troubleshooting that the Number One Fire Bottle Squib indication light for the number two engine was not illuminating during testing. I determined that Minimum Equipment List 26-21-02A would be an effective solution; but it would require additional in-depth troubleshooting of the Fire Detection and Suppression System inside the engine pylon before the Minimum Equipment List could be applied. This would cause considerable delay in departure. I briefed the flight crew of the situation; they were obviously displeased. While troubleshooting the Fire Protection Indication on the Fire Control Panel in the cockpit; the Number One Fire Bottle for the #2 engine was inadvertently discharged. The fire bottle was replaced inside the engine pylon; but in the course of this maintenance procedure; the explosive squib used to activate the fire bottle was not replaced. A new Fire Bottle Squib was not included with the replacement Fire Bottle Assembly. The Troubleshooting Procedures were completed and it was determined that Minimum Equipment List 26.21.02A could be applied in this situation and the aircraft returned to service. Late in my shift with very low outdoor air temperatures and several through flight aircraft in my work area; I was tasked with troubleshooting the Fire Indication/Suppression System for an aircraft at departure time. Suggest adequate staffing to address the daily workload placed on maintenance personnel with adequate and complete parts availability and support. [We need] a work environment without the ongoing disruption and upheaval of multiple interests with differing agendas and divergent goals.
2,Equipment List,As I was reviewing deferred items at the start of the day; I noticed [an Airbus A319] had the ground spoilers 3 and 4 deferred under an Minimum Equipment List. While reviewing the Minimum Equipment List I saw that the Minimum Equipment List [procedure called for] pulling the circuit breaker for SEC (spoiler elevator computer) 3 which renders required ground spoilers 1 and 2 inoperative. The aircraft had already flown one flight [in this condition]. I immediately grounded the aircraft. [The station Maintenance personnel] cleared the issue with a SEC 1 replacement. Minimum Equipment List Engineering was again notified of the Minimum Equipment List problem and they have provided access restrictions to the Minimum Equipment List. I confirmed that the restrictions were in place.
2,Equipment List,During normal operations; Minimum Equipment List 27-92-02c was issued for Marker - 'F/Control SPLR FAULT'. [Deferred under] Minimum Equipment List 27-92-02C; GROUND SPOILERS 1 AND 2 - INOPERATIVE (Inoperative) with <Airport> Mechanic. The same condition was experienced in December 2012 [noted] in Logbook. I inadvertently issued the same Minimum Equipment List thinking the Marker fault was the same as the previous fault. During the operation; while aircraft was in service at gate; Captain on flight questioned if the proper Minimum Equipment List was initially applied. Oversight [was] due to a high volume workload. After review of the Minimum Equipment List List; the Minimum Equipment List was reclassified to Minimum Equipment List 27-64-01A in Logbook for 'Spoiler Surface 1 - Inoperative - DEACTIVATED'. [Recommend] taking more time to study and understand the condition for Spoiler Surfaces during the aircraft ground time.
2,Equipment List,Our aircraft was late arriving. As the last passenger deplaned I entered the cabin via door 1L and noticed the 1R EXIT marking sign was very dim. On closer inspection there were 6 of 14 bulbs not illuminated which put the sign significantly outside of Minimum Equipment List tolerances and could potentially ground the aircraft at a station where parts were not available. I immediately notified Maintenance and wrote it up in the AML. When; during the crew briefing; I informed the flight attendants of the discrepancy they informed me that several other signs in the cabin were similarly dim. I inspected the cabin and found more EXIT Marking and several EXIT Location signs outside of Minimum Equipment List tolerances. I wrote them up in the AML per the company's safety/maintenance policy for repair. Maintenance arrived and suspended passenger boarding to accommodate their work in the cabin to fix the EXIT signs. With an approximate 10 minute delay on passenger boarding the lights were revamped and boarding resumed. Maintenance took the AML into the jetway to complete the paperwork to document the repair. After completion of the repair the Maintenance technician returned the AML to the flight deck for our approval. As I looked over the repairs in the AML the technician waited in the flight deck. When I finished he wanted to know if I was the Captain that did the write up. When I answered in the affirmative he asked 'Do you hate us (Maintenance) or do you just like writing up things at departure time and causing delays? Have a nice day.' Without an answer he turned and exited the flight deck. I followed him onto the jetbridge and asked if he wanted an answer to his question and he responded; 'I know the answer. I was just being facetious. Have a nice day.' I consider both answers unacceptable and inappropriate in a Safe; Regulatory Compliant and harassment free workplace. Each and every write-up was outside of the Minimum Equipment List tolerances with a total of 25 bulbs not illuminated. The Minimum Equipment List allows for a total of 18 bulbs to be inoperative on the ENTIRE aircraft with no more than three in any of the 6 EXIT marking and 0 (zero) in the 4 EXIT Location signs. The bulbs required for this repair are not carried on board the aircraft in the spare bulb inventory. If the write-up had taken place at an outstation the delay would have been significant; historically 6-7 hours; to fly the bulbs in for the 10 minute repair. Our flight departed the gate eight minutes late and arrived at its destination only two minutes behind schedule. Our prompt response and coordination with Maintenance and passenger service avoided what could have been a significant delay. I have verified with several sources and determined that exit lighting deficiencies are required to be corrected on the aircraft's weekly check; at a minimum; yet I continued to receive aircraft with significant cabin EXIT Marking and EXIT Location sign deficiencies fresh out of multiple; required; periodic checks with airworthiness releases. Falsification; Neglect and Incompetency are words that should never be applied to a company where SAFETY and REGULATORY COMPLIANCE are cornerstone phrases in their MISSION STATEMENT. Yet; company Maintenance has a history of neglect and falsification of the required weekly cabin light checks. These lights (EXIT Location and EXIT Marking Signs) are consistently outside (by a considerable margin) tolerances allowed by the pertinent Minimum Equipment List. If Maintenance Management would emphasize the importance of servicing them; line technicians would understand how to fix and maintain them so as to avoid future delays and confrontations with conscientious flight crews. Management should include cabin light service in the daily check for at least one month to allow all aircraft to be brought into Minimum Equipment List compliance. Additionally; we should add at least one bag (25) of the appropriate bulbs to the onboard bulb inventory to avoid delays at outstations.
2,Equipment List,Aircraft arrived [at the airport] on Second Shift and during postflight walkaround it was noted that the right-hand Krueger/Notch Flap was leaking. Mechanic Y and myself determined that the aircraft could be dispatched by applying Minimum Equipment List 27-88-02. After reviewing the Minimum Equipment List; Mechanic Y applied the Maintenance Procedures and I performed the RII function due to the item affecting a flight control and the complexity of the Minimum Equipment List procedures. After lockout of the noted flight control; I believe the trapped hydraulic fluid bleed off allowed the Krueger/Notch Flap to slowly deploy in flight which caused the [flight] diversion.The Minimum Equipment List currently has you verify the flight control remains retracted by observing it for 10-minutes. This time could be lengthened due to the possibility of a very slow bleed off of fluid. Deferral of Krueger/Notch Flap System.
2,Equipment List,The aircraft arrived with Minimum Equipment List 32-60-04-XX: Fault(s) Indicated by BRAKES N/WS MINOR FAULT Caution on Marker E/WD; Not Confirmed by a Brake Pressure Transducer Fault??? which was added a couple days earlier. This Minimum Equipment List requires Alternate Braking System is checked 'operative' before the first flight of each day. Although it wasn't the first flight of the day for the aircraft; it was our first flight of the day on that aircraft; and for peace of mind; we decided to perform the Alternate Braking System Check described in the Minimum Equipment List. The test failed; the Alternate Braking System did not work correctly. This caused a five hour delay. It is very likely the aircraft flew several legs without an operational alternate braking system. It was subsequently discovered that the Left Normal (Green) Brake Pressure Transducer was faulty (it constantly sensed 2;000 PSI pressure regardless of the actual pressure). So it's unclear to me if it should have instead been dispatched under Minimum Equipment List 32-60-04-XY; 'Fault(s) Indicated by BRAKES N/WS MINOR FAULT Caution on Marker E/WD'; following a Confirmed Fault on a Brake Pressure Transducer'. I believe several brake related Minimum Equipment List items are unsafe because they allow aircraft to be dispatched without an operational ALTERNATE Braking System. The Minimum Equipment List procedures related to faulty brake pressure transducers seem to be correct only when a faulty transducer does not sense pressure and indicates zero pressure. But the procedures don't make sense when a faulty transducer erroneously indicates a positive pressure. Even though Minimum Equipment List 32-60-04-XY was probably the correct Minimum Equipment List and 32-60-04-XX was applied instead; the situation would have been less safe and would not have been recognized if the correct Minimum Equipment List was applied; since 32-60-04-XY doesn't require an Alternate Brake Check at all. Minimum Equipment List 32-60-04-XX says the 'BRAKES N/WS MINOR FAULT' Marker message may be displayed provided: A). BRAKES pressure indicators operate normally. B). Alternate Braking System is checked 'operative' before the first flight of each day; and C). It is checked prior to each departure that the following Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS) failure message related to BRAKES N/WS MINOR FAULT is not displayed: A fault on Alternate Pressure Transducer. Condition A and C were met on all flights. Condition B was met only on the first flight of each day. With a faulty 'Normal' brake pressure transducer erroneously sensing a positive pressure; the Alternate Braking System would test OK on the first flight of the day (if the aircraft electrical power was cycled off overnight); and all the conditions to dispatched under that Minimum Equipment List would be met. However; the Alternate Braking System would subsequently not be operational. That's because after powering up the aircraft; the braking system is defaulting to ALTERNATE and will pass the test described in the Minimum Equipment List. But once the 'Normal' Braking System is used (the Green Hydraulic System is pressurized and the brake pedals are pressed); the BSCU's won't automatically revert to ALTERNATE braking in case of loss of Green hydraulic pressure if they sense pressure from a 'Normal' brake pressure transducer (the Marker WHEEL page will indicate the Braking System is in Alternate; but there will be no brakes available unless the A/SKID and N/W STRG switch is turned 'Off' or the parking brake is used). Similarly; Minimum Equipment List: 'BRAKES Pressure Indicators' allows a flight to be dispatched with a faulty alternate pressure transducer. But I'm not certain it should [be] allowed to do so with a pressure transducer erroneously sensing a positive pressure. Was the BSCU logic taken into account for this case? (Specifically; after landing gear extension; when the BSCU tests the braking systems.) I think Minimum Equipment List 32-60-04 and probably Minimum Equipment List 32-44-03 should not apply when a brake transducer erroneously senses a positive pressure. I think the 'Alternate Brakes Check procedure in Minimum Equipment List 32-60-04-XX should begin with steps to pressurize the Green Hydraulic System and apply 'Normal' brake pressure; then test the automatic reversion to Alternate Braking System after losing Green hydraulic pressure. Also; I think Minimum Equipment List 32-60-04-XY should require an Alternate Brakes Check. Flight delay. Procedures inadequate.
2,Equipment List,The Minimum Equipment List card in hand indicated for the Avionics Fault deferral 'both packs must operate normally'. The key word being normally. In the responders text below he indicates a class 2 maintenance message is a 'faults detected by the system' that do not affect dispatch. Or as stated in the Flight Manual 'failure within a system'. I completely agree with the stand alone definitions of the class 2 maintenance message but tie that same definition 'failure/fault within a system' with the Minimum Equipment List cards mandate of 'both packs must operate normally' and there I have an issue. The definition states 'failure/fault' and the Minimum Equipment List cards says operate normally. Again I would have a difficult time explaining to a Federal Aviation Administration lawyer how a system definition of 'failure/fault' can coexist in the same system mandating 'operate normally'.I disagree with the responder's text in that he said the two Minimum Equipment List's are not in conflict with each other yet his own definition of a class 2 message states;These are faults detected by the systems and which DO NOT have any operational consequences (safety aspects) on the CURRENT flight or on the FOLLOWING flight(s) but which may have consequences if a second fault occurs. These faults are indicated to the cockpit crew on ground by a Maintenance STATUS on the Marker STATUS page after the engines shut down. Original report follows below:Notice the responder states 'if a second fault occurs'; thus there had to be an initial fault. Again I have an issue with explaining the initial fault/failure associated with 'must operate normally' because there is no way of knowing if that initial fault still existed at time of dispatch; or even what the cause of it was.Second; pilot pushing. It is my understanding that this person has agreed that during aircraft refusals Captains will be asked the following questions.1.Are you ok?2.Is there anything I can do to help?As this refusal played out there was much more coercion from the company than what was agreed to by this person. That issue was not specifically addressed. I hope that it is being addressed behind the scenes.The original report and response follow for reference.We were scheduled to fly this airplane with the following four deferrals. 1. Aft cargo heat deferred 2. Center tank fuel pump deferred 3. Avionics system fault (ASF) Minimum Equipment List 21XXX 4. Outboard flap rub stripI arrived at the cockpit to find a mechanic performing the needed tests for the Avionics System Fault (ASF) deferral. I sat in my seat and started my preflight. While performing his tests we got a class 2 maintenance message 'pack 2'. I assumed the mechanic would fix that issue since it directly related to our ASF deferral. He left without saying anything. After a long delay and it appeared maintenance was not going to work that issue so we wrote it up. The same mechanic came back with a deferral sticker in his hand and deferred the class 2 message. I said that was there when you left and I assumed you would fix it. He said 'yea I saw it'; but I assumed from his actions he chose not to work it. I found it somewhat disturbing that in performing his required test a class 2 message came up; he saw it but did not to work it. In referencing Minimum Equipment List for the ASF it says under Flight Crew 'both packs must operate normally'. I asked the mechanic who was deferring the class 2 maintenance message what was wrong with pack 2. He said 'I don't know'. I asked him how can I take the airplane with a class 2 maintenance message for pack 2 in conjunction with Minimum Equipment List that specifically stated 'both packs must operate normally' if no one can tell me what is wrong; if anything with pack 2. He said 'it's deferrable'. I disagreed and refused the plane. I phoned dispatch; told them of the refusal and why I was refusing the aircraft. The dispatcher immediately phoned Maintenance Control (MC) and put him on the line. MC said this was a legal deferral. I asked how it could be if Minimum Equipment List said 'both packs must operate normally' and I had a class 2 maintenance message for pack 2 and nobody knew what was wrong with pack 2 causing the message. MC said it doesn't make a difference class 2 messages could be for many things and we don't know what is causing this message but it's not associated with Minimum Equipment List. I again referenced the statement 'both packs must operate normally' and said if you can clear the class 2 message OR tell me what is causing the class 2 message I will take the plane if the class 2 message in fact confirms the pack 2 is operating normally. He said he could not again reaffirming his stance it was a legal deferral. I reiterated my aircraft refusal and the conversation ended. The next three or four phone calls were from the Flight Operations Manager asking why I refused the plane and again reaffirming that it was a legal refusal. I gave him my opinion as stated to MC above and the Flight Operations Manager still thought it was a legal deferral. I spoke to another mechanic who was on the flight deck working the issue and he said on the original deferral for the ASF Minimum Equipment List maintenance should have changed a 'box' which they did not do thus making the deferral incomplete and that they would have to change the 'box' to make the deferral complete. I phoned the Flight Operations Manager and told him about that conversation. Later the Flight Operations Manager called back saying the mechanic was incorrect and the deferral was correct. I told the Flight Operations Manager I had 3 witnesses to the conversation with the mechanic and I did not misunderstand him. Again the Flight Operations Manager asked if I was willing to fly the plane now; I said no for the stated reason. The plane was subsequently taken out of service. I spoke to another mechanic (different than any of the others I had spoken to) and asked him about the 'box' issue and he confirmed what the other mechanic had said that the box was not changed and they were taking the plane out of service.If the deferral was legal; as the company claims; then why did they take the plane out of service? If it was legal then how does one explain Minimum Equipment List 'both packs must operate normally' while simultaneously I had a class 2 maintenance message for pack 2 and nobody could tell me what was wrong with pack 2? The Flight Manual states in reference to class 2 maintenance messages 'Failure within a system that usually does not affect the flight'. That statement from the Flight Manual says 'usually'; in this instance wherein the Minimum Equipment List says 'both packs must operate normally' and the Flight Manual starts its description of class 2 maintenance message with 'Failure within a system'; how can that be a legal deferral? Nobody was willing or able to tell me what caused the class 2 maintenance message. I kept telling the Flight Operations Manager that if someone could tell me what caused the message so a more informed decision could be made or clear the message I would take the aircraft. Neither happened and the plane went to the hanger. This is an alarming trend that I see continuing over the last few years. The company has become very persuasive in attempting to get pilots to fly airplanes the company deems safe yet the Captain; for whatever reason; does not. Gone are the days of the company asking if they can help in anyway and here are the days of the company strong arming pilots into taking airplanes deemed unsafe or illegal. This is not my first report on the same subject; I see the alarming trend continuing and worry that illegal and unsafe planes are being flown because of the strong arming of the company only for the on-time and completion rates. When Captains refuse airplanes the company should stop handing us over to the Flight Operations Manager and MC and we listen while they try to change our minds. MC's job should be to fix the issue not try and coerce pilots into flying airplanes deemed unsafe. The Flight Operations Manager should be there to help and support the Captain and facilitate getting the plane fixed not spend time trying to get the Captain to fly an airplane he/she has already refused. With over 31 years of airline flying the degradation of Captains authority via pilot pushing has never been as bad as the last two to three years at this company. I hope this report not only brings light to my refusal stated above but to the overall continuing trend of pilot pushing by the management. Action Item Response This is the Definition of a class 2 fault according to Airbus and is contained in AMM 31-32-00-0001. (b) Class 2 faults. These are faults detected by the systems and which DO NOT have any operational consequences (safety aspects) on the CURRENT flight or on the FOLLOWING flight(s) but which may have consequences if a second fault occurs. These faults are indicated to the cockpit crew on ground by a Maintenance STATUS on the Marker STATUS page after the engines shut down. System faults that result only in messages on the CFDS (centralized fault display system) do not affect dispatch and do not require action other than addressed within the company's maintenance program. So the 2 Minimum Equipment List's were not in conflict with each other. The original Minimum Equipment List was for an Avionics system fault. The reason the Minimum Equipment List states that both packs must operate normally is due to equipment cooling requirements and at the time of departure BOTH packs were operating normally. The 2nd Minimum Equipment List was for the class 2 MAINTENANCE fault; which by the definition has no operational consequences on the current flight and the Minimum Equipment List does not require any maintenance action be taken on the initial deferral. The Aircraft (Alternating Current) was not taken out of service due to the MELs on the Alternating Current. It was taken out of service so that a plane change could be facilitated due to the crew refusal.
2,Equipment List,I arrived for my 4th of 4 days. The plane had 4 MELs to begin with. I'll focus on two.After reviewing the Minimum Equipment List; there were several people questioning whether we could even apply this specific Minimum Equipment List. The MOD list needed to be referenced and after that was complete it came down to the word 'OR' as the aircraft had one MOD installed but not the other. After 40 minutes of discussion; the [release] was modified. If you also include the passenger medical issue requiring a paramedic sign off; you can see it was a very busy morning already. After successful engine start; we performed the first control check (not required by the Minimum Equipment List) and observed only 'pair 3' locked out. Per the sign off; the aircraft needed both sets disabled. We needed to leave the ramp for company to push. With all the General Aviation traffic the only place to go was the end of the runway. After a quick review of the Minimum Equipment List; for either a paperwork swap to one pair inop or for two pair inop; we needed a MX. We verified this with Maintenance; :25 later (can't remember exactly) we parked at the gate. Just to take a second here. The system was 'Minimum Equipment List'ed' on the 4th and flew. We're the spoilers correctly disconnected? If so; did they trouble shoot overnight and not re-comply? These two items I don't have the info for but I do know for a fact I was given the plane with a non-compliant Minimum Equipment List procedure. Company manager met us and inquired about the situation. I gave him a quick airbus systems dissertation on why we were back at the gate. MX quickly met us and took the logbook to examine the work and why we weren't in compliance. Within :10 or so they were back and another :03 the new procedure was apparently completed. 'Wow I thought that was quick'. Looking at the F/Control page we now had 3/4 spoilers 'X-ed' out. Even though it did not call for the next step; I insisted we do a control check prior to push. They cleared the outside and the 'visible cockpit indications' showed correct deflections. We buttoned up and pushed back. Maybe an hour late? This is the SECOND TIME we were apparently Minimum Equipment List compliant. I can't speak for what the other crew saw but as for us; everything we saw on the instruments and paperwork said we were in compliance. My First Officer  Heading HDG(S) (First Officer) was flying the first leg. It was windy for our departure. Rotation was normal but the coordination and turning were sloppy; probably due to both turbulence and 1/2 of the roll spoilers gone. As we accelerated thru 12;000 ft and the ride calmed down thru the upper teens; we started to notice the LH (Left Hand) wing start to indicate a slight wing down indication on the PFD. As we climbed further and transitioned to Mach; the indication continued. We changed to the #1 DFGC (Digital Flight Guidance Computer); at first there appeared to be some improvement but that later mimicked #2. We disconnected the autopilot and manually trimmed the plane out with the rudder. We couldn't fully right the wings. Once we leveled at FL360; we reengaged #2 and watched the PFD/F/Control indications. 2-3deg LH turn on the PFD; LH AIL (Aileron) outside the cruise ticks; RH (Right Hand) AIL normal. Rudder showing a 1.7deg R deflection. Hmmm. Why?We started communication via Automatic Communications Addressing & Reporting System with dispatch and MX. Over the next hour the problem continued to progress to a greater offset and more rudder correction. We tried again to disconnect and manually fly but this time there was no correction to be had. We couldn't level the wings. VERY uneasy feeling in a FBW (Fly by Wire) plane that has no aileron trim installedAt our Top Of Descent (Top of Descent); the first step down; it actually felt like the plane was in a mild 'slip'. Not indicated as much but we were definitely not tracking straight. We took a conservative descent approach. The headwinds helped get us down in time. We vectored into the pattern eventually on the downwind. Every time we turned (especially to the left) we experienced a very noticeable uncoordinated slip all the way thru the turn. These factors continued to worsen until we passed flaps 2. Then all indications flopped. Rudder inputs remained but opposite aileron and spoiler indications. At 600 ft we have LH AIL deflected 50-60% down; RH AIL deflected 30-40% up. ALL REMAINING spoilers on RH wing extended normal rudder indications but we were in a slip down the Glideslope (One Word). We increased speed and flew a shallow approach as we had 11;000' ft + to land on. It was a positive touchdown in light winds and Visual Flight Rules conditions. We used more braking than reverse for this landing; the rollout was normal. I felt VERY uneasy and out of control while operating this airplane that I have trusted now for 2 1/2 years. When we arrived at the gate; a mechanic (as I requested) met the plane. As I began to enter as much data into the logbook; the First Officer  Heading HDG(S) sends me a picture of the LH wing. THE LOCKED OUT #4 SPOILER IS DEFLECTED 10-15deg. This is impossible I said to myself! It's locked out electrically via SEC1 and the MX procedure should have had the existing hydraulic pressure holding it in place. We've all read the articles about spoiler float and it can present in different ways; poor rotation or extended TO (Takeoff) run; poor handling; rumbling; etc. of which the handling was assumed; initially; to be the missing spoilers.After a very thorough search by our 'unexperienced airbus on call MX'; we discovered the panel WAS NEVER LOCKED OUT. ONLY TWO OF THE THREE STEPS WERE FOLLOWED. This was the 3rd miss by our maintenance team. I talked in great length with [Maintenance Operations]; 3 different dispatchers; the duty pilot and my crew about the situation and how we felt the plane may be unsafe to fly. I think what I was looking for was a 100% '. Yes this was a spoiler float event and not electrically influenced.' We never received such a statement. For a large portion of the delay I was convinced I was not moving the plane anywhere. We eventually came to an agreement after several control checks; inspecting the spoilers myself and factoring in all the other 'pros' we had (long runway; Visual Flight Rules; light winds; only 142k) that we would take the plane. We planned on engaging the autopilot very early in the flight and if the wing dipped; even a bit; we were going to declare an emergency; apply the penalty and land overweight. We loaded after an extensive delay. During Eng #2 start; we experienced an IGN (Ignition) B failure that needed to be deferred. I'll just mention here this system has been deferred more than just once. I reluctantly say more than 10 because that may not be factual but if someone was looking at the history; I'd bet I'm not far off. I know they have replaced several parts and continue to troubleshoot but the #2 motors' initial power applications lag; and normal starts have taken 1:40. All significantly different than others but that's another story. At times this aircraft has carried 8+ MELs at one time. This is a great barrier to completing on time; reliable and predictable operations for our customers. During this delay; we needed to amend the release for fuel burn AND extend :30 to complete our mission. At no time did the company or safety or the duty pilot or whoever just ask how we were. Look at this chain of events? It's NOT supposed to be like this. I hope I caught everything I needed to because we were definitely doing the job of SEVERAL departments this day. This was easily one of the top 5 most challenging days I've had here. Disappointment and major frustration don't begin to explain my feelings surrounding this event. The possibility of an aircraft accident was created by incomplete maintenance procedures; and the lack of possibly parts; tools; or personnel to complete either the deferral or a repair. This is supposed to be a fairly routine procedure. This incident indicates a need for properly trained maintenance technicians and some sort of cross check being implemented for these aircraft.It highlights the need for readdressing how this company perceivesits maintenance function. While maintenance may have failed to accomplish a maintenance procedure; other links in the chain held fast. A properly trained crew was able to safely fly a compromised airframe; without further damage. I hope that I have been able to convey the importance of this incident. This event points out how dangerously thin this company's resources are apparently being pulled. It's also apparent that the schedule pressure is obviously elevated at the expense of a thorough procedure.
2,Equipment List,During engine start ADR 1 faulted repeatedly. Contacted Maintenance Control and did a successful com reset followed by an info only write up.  Within a minute of taxi ADR 1 faulted again. Contacted Maintenance Control. They wanted to do another reset but I declined. This had been written up previously as well. We returned to the gate where maintenance began another reset. I expressed my concern that we had a history of resets and failures...they said well then we are going to defer it.  They swapped number one and three ADR as one is non deferrable. Upon review First Officer  Heading HDG(S) and I became concerned as the Minimum Equipment List states effectivity A320 and subsequent. We were in A320. Contacted Maintenance Control; he was unsure and consulted his Supervisor who said it's good. I asked where I could find a reference to this as First Officer  Heading HDG(S) and I had been digging through the Minimum Equipment List preamble to confirm the validity.  We could not. We then contacted Dispatch; asked for both amendment for time and Minimum Equipment List and expressed our concern over the verbiage. I then contacted crew schedule and asked to be transferred to the chief pilot on duty. They asked if I wanted the number and I said yes but also to transfer me. I was connected to a chief pilot not on duty. He asked me (reasonably) to contact the chief pilot who WAS on duty. I called the number provided by schedule and again was greeted by the same voice. He provided me with the number for the chief pilot on duty. I then called him. He referenced the Minimum Equipment List and did some research and ascertained we were good to go. Shortly after liftoff ADR 1 failed resulting in a cascade of additional failures. Gear stuck down; direct law; man trim; no auto thrust and of course; no instrumentation for the Captain (Pilot Flying). I established a positive flight trajectory;  confirmed the First Officer  Heading HDG(S) had reasonable indications from ADR 2 (our newest best friend) and transferred control. We established a box pattern while we worked through the Marker and com including landing distance procedures. We returned to the departure airport; chose to brace the passengers; and landed uneventfully. Back end crew did an outstanding job managing passengers as well as following Standard Operating Procedure and protocol. First Officer  Heading HDG(S) displayed excellent airmanship and Cockpit Resource Management. Truly did a great job.I felt as though we were completely on our own trying to resolve the maint issue prior to flight.  During the event dispatch had Air Traffic Control relay that they wanted us to contact them. Just the teeniest bit too busy for that. Seems like they might have preemptively sent us an acars with landing data as a backup to the charts.  That would have been helpful.
2,Equipment List,During descent; we had continuous Marker warnings and cautions associated with the Minimum Equipment List. On short final and after turning the auto thrust off; the number one engine rolled back to idle thrust. We were unable to recover engine thrust on the number one engine. We continued the approach and landed the aircraft without incident. I was very concerned about the aircraft flying the rest of the day with the faults associated with the Minimum Equipment List. I called the safety department hot line representative and the Chief Pilot on duty to voice my concerns determine the proper Minimum Equipment List.
2,Equipment List,Unable to operate Aircraft X [from] <Airport  (Domestic)> due to multiple Minimum Equipment List's [Minimum Equipment List] on the fuel system.
2,Equipment List,Dispatched with Minimum Equipment List ELAC [Elevator Aileron Computer] 1 fault...below 1;000 feet; First Officer  Heading HDG(S) disconnected autopilot and at 500 feet First Officer  Heading HDG(S) stated his control stick was not responding to his inputs.  I immediately took control of the aircraft and completed a normal landing since my controls were working fine and I deemed it safer than going around with a possible flight control/control stick anomaly. No associated ECAMs came on.Suggestions: Don't allow Dispatch with an ELAC fault as allowed per Minimum Equipment List if it turns out this was related to Minimum Equipment List.
2,Equipment List,During the walk around at <Airport  (Domestic)> the First Officer noticed a cable on the nose wheel assembly was zip tied to a hydraulic line and the connector was covered with plastic. (see attachment) During the flight deck preflight I noticed there wasn't a NW STR DISC memo on the Marker (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor). I mentioned it to the First Officer  Heading HDG(S) (First Officer); he showed me the picture and mentioned that the disconnected cable may be the cause. I radioed <Airport  (Domestic)> maintenance and told them we had no NW STR memo and that we couldn't move the aircraft without it. A mechanic arrived; confirmed the pin was installed and stated we could placard/Minimum Equipment List (Minimum Equipment list) the Marker memo and be on our way. I said that I'd prefer it if he reconnected the cable first and see if that fixes the issue. He inspected the nose gear; reconnected the cable and the issue was resolved. If we would've put the issue on Minimum Equipment List and then subsequently retracted the gear there could've been serious damage to the electrical and hydraulic lines on the nose gear since they were zip tied together. The aircraft was a RON (Remain Overnight) in <Airport  (Domestic)> and it arrived with Minimum Equipment List for National Weather Service bypass pin lever clip broken. The spring clip was replaced and signed off as 'OPS check good' and the Minimum Equipment List cleared. During the re-activation process the electric harness was supposed to be reconnected and it wasn't. Follow the re-activation steps as published. A check of the recent maintenance history and they would've noticed the system in question was repaired just a few hours earlier. As a result; they could've made a more thorough inspection of the system rather than just looking at the pin and suggesting we put it on Minimum Equipment List.
2,Equipment List,I was the Captain assigned on Flight ABCD scheduled <Airport  (Domestic)> to <Airport>. Flight release indicated Minimum Equipment List item on Aircraft with the ELAC 1 computer reported fault from inbound crew the night before. Review of flight release and Aircraft Logbook showed flight was released under Minimum Equipment List 27-XXB. option 2. Both First Officer (First Officer  Heading HDG(S)) and I carefully reviewed the five pages of the Minimum Equipment List requirements prior to departure and discussed our plan of action prior to departure. Our initial review of the AML showed that the Minimum Equipment List action had been done by Maintenance; the Yellow form placard was in front of the logbook. ELAC 1 push button was placarded inoperative with inoperative sticker.After engine start and pushback; we requested taxi to a spot where we could conduct the required Minimum Equipment List ELAC/SEC check. We used the Minimum Equipment List carefully to comply with each step; however we did not see the expected responses or results on the system displays to confirm a satisfactory check. After several attempts to ensure we complied with the Minimum Equipment List procedure; I decided we needed to return to the gate and consult with Maintenance.Upon return to the gate; we discussed with the <Airport  (Domestic)> Mechanic our observations of the Minimum Equipment List procedures. The Mechanic reviewed our AML and informed me that although the Minimum Equipment List for the ELAC 1 deferral was properly entered in the AML; the actual signoff for the flight was not entered. Further investigation revealed that the actual maintenance required actions for the Minimum Equipment List were not completed prior to the flight.Maintenance completed the required actions for the Minimum Equipment List procedure. Then; observed as the First Officer  Heading HDG(S) and I completed the operational preflight checks as required by the Minimum Equipment List procedure. All results were satisfactory and the passengers were re-boarded. The AML entries were completed correctly and we departed without further incident. Maintenance Personnel did not comply with Minimum Equipment List procedures in the Minimum Equipment List during overnight shift. We were not made aware of this until after we returned to the gate.I recently transitioned to the airbus from another type aircraft. With less than 100 hours in type; I have not had a lot of experience with the A320 Minimum Equipment List; and specifically not with the flight control system. Even with diligence; I misread the Minimum Equipment List operational directions; and wrongly interpreted the requirements for Dispatch with the AML sign off.A very poorly written 27-XXB. Option 2 Minimum Equipment List contributed to our misunderstanding of the Minimum Equipment List compliance requirements. Had the Minimum Equipment List stated 'Complete operational check prior to engine start' then it would have cleared up all confusion on the part of the flight crew. A five-page operational Minimum Equipment List is complicated and must be completed with great care. Rewrite the Minimum Equipment List 27-XXB. Option 2 Minimum Equipment List procedure to state 'Operational check must be performed prior to engine start.Specifically; include and incorporate ELAC 1 or 2 fault; Minimum Equipment List 27-XXB. Option 2; as a Minimum Equipment List work exercise in the initial A320 training syllabus. The flight control system; with its hydraulic powered components is a very complicated and a critical system. Working through the problem of an ELAC fault Minimum Equipment List Dispatch procedure will train any pilot to a better understanding of both the Minimum Equipment List procedures and the flight control system.Better oversight of station Maintenance assignment and completion. It is my understanding that the compliance with the Maintenance portion of the Minimum Equipment List was interrupted by various distractions; including a shift change causing the incomplete Dispatch and AML documentation.
2,Equipment List,The aircraft in question was operating with Minimum Equipment List 27-XXX open; Spoilers #2 or #4. After engine start on both legs; an Marker message was received regarding the spoilers but this was disregarded as a result of the Minimum Equipment List. Upon further reflection; these messages should have triggered further investigation on my part; as the presence of such an alert was not mentioned in the Minimum Equipment List. However; I had noted a write-up in the Minimum Equipment List about spurious messages - made by a Check Airman - which was subsequently signed off by Maintenance as essentially being unimportant. The aircraft had flown 4 legs the day prior with the Minimum Equipment List active. Also; at the time of this incident; I had approximately 100 hours of experience in any Airbus aircraft.The first leg of the day was flown uneventfully. Immediately after takeoff on our second leg of the day with the same plane; an Marker caution and audio alert was triggered for a F/Control SPLR FAULT. The message subsequently cleared itself; but then a few seconds later; would trigger again. This cycle repeated itself approximately every 20-30 seconds for about 20 minutes; until the flight reached FL270; where the message stopped cycling and instead remained. Initially; after exiting the sterile period; Automatic Communications Addressing & Reporting System messages were sent and a brief exchange ensued. An emergency return to <Airport  (Domestic)> was offered as an option; but given that we were well above maximum landing weight and the Marker did not require us to land as soon as possible; I elected to continue the climb.Upon reaching cruise altitude; I transferred the flying duties to the First Officer  Heading HDG(S) (First Officer) and verbally contacted Dispatch and eventually Maintenance Control. Maintenance had no inflight suggestions and stated that they would look at it when the plane is on the ground. At this point; the Dispatcher and I discussed our options. Since the Marker mentioned FUEL CONSUMPTION INCREASED and FMS PRED UNRELIABLE and we still had just under 3 hours to go on a flight planned to land with just 8;000 LBS of fuel; the decision was made to divert to <Airport>. Dispatch changed our destination and we proceeded to an uneventful landing in <Airport>. An emergency was not declared. While on the ground in <Airport>; one of the responding mechanics reported to me that he discovered that the Minimum Equipment List procedures were not properly complied with when the item was deferred and that Spoiler Pair #2 was inadvertently deactivated instead of Pair #4. Apparently; the aircraft had flown 4 legs in this condition prior to our operating it. He mentioned to me his concern that on the [day prior]; a previous crew; the previously mentioned Check Airman had also apparently experienced a similar condition; wrote it in the logbook; only to have Maintenance simply clear the entry by writing 'info noted.' He expected that the aircraft would be taken out of service to fix the underlying issue. However; the decision was made to clear the write-up that I made and allow the deferral to continue. Based on the information that was relayed to me by this Mechanic; it appears that the initial error of deactivating the wrong spoiler pair was attempting to be covered up. This is very concerning.My relative inexperience with Airbus aircraft allowed me to be lulled into a false sense of security when it came to Marker messages that appeared to relate to the Minimum Equipment List item. Seeing a write-up about spurious messages being handled the way it had been also led me to believe that there was nothing out of the ordinary; when realistically; there was a major error made by a certificated Mechanic. In retrospect; what was displayed on the F/Control page should have alerted me to a problem; with both Spoiler Pairs #2 and #4; but I assumed that this was the same display that the mechanics and all of the other pilots who operated the aircraft before me also saw. The Minimum Equipment List does not give us specific guidance as to what should be displayed on this page with the Minimum Equipment List active; but I presume that the AMM (Aircraft Maintenance Manual) procedure referenced should tell the Mechanic whatshould have been displayed.More information in the Minimum Equipment List document detailing what exactly should be displayed on the SD (System Display) and what messages the crew should or shouldn't expect for a given Minimum Equipment List. Also; if there was indeed an attempt to cover up a maintenance error; I think this case should be used as an example as to how to properly correct an error.
2,Equipment List,After reviewing the Aircraft log for Aircraft X; I concluded that I was unable to operate the aircraft due to Minimum Equipment List and the maintenance notes associated. The aircraft had been operating with this Minimum Equipment List and was to continue operating for another 2 days before getting fixed. The aircraft arrived from a 24 plus hour maintenance delay down in <Airport (Foreign)> due to a hydraulic issue. I felt the prudent thing for Aircraft X was to have some time at a maintenance hanger to address Minimum Equipment List before operating another revenue flight. We were swapped into Aircraft Y and I was unable to select Aircraft X for this report. Just want to make sure there is no confusion.
2,Equipment List,"Aircraft X; A220; <Airport  (Domestic)> to <Airport>; taxiing to XXR for takeoff. Started 2nd engine during taxi. Shortly after start; got: LH Engine FAULT"" - cyan Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System . ""30 - LH Engine COWL AI REDUND LOSS"" - info synoptic. Coordinated with Air Traffic Control to pull over and assess our options. Quick check of Minimum Equipment List showed no available Minimum Equipment List to apply to this message. Called Dispatch/Maintenance Control to discuss. Maintenance Control confirmed no applicable Minimum Equipment List. Decided to conference call Airbus Tech Representative; Name; for any additional insight. Name had information about this condition and suggested: shut down LH engine; restart LH engine - swaps channels; shut down LH engine 2nd time; [and]; restart LH engine - swaps back to original channel that triggered our LH Engine COWL AI message. After accomplishing these restarts our COWL AI message had cleared.We were then instructed to run up the engine to approximately 80% N2; and then manually turn the LH Wing AI ON. We did this with Maintenance Control and the Airbus Representative on our conference call. The engine was operated at approximately 82% N2 for roughly 5 seconds while the Cowl AI was operated. Everything now worked normally; and the system had been reset. Maintenance Control advised that a logbook entry would not be required since we were able to reset the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System  message... the problems we had encountered could be considered ""transient"" and we were authorized to continue our flight without logbook entries to address. The entire conference call and reset took approximately 20 minutes; and we were able to initiate our takeoff roll with minimum takeoff fuel +150 lb.After we had climbed above 10K; I researched the FOM for engine runs with customers onboard and discovered that we should have limited thrust to idle power for that situation. This was my fault as I did not realize the specific details about our engine run policy with customers onboard."""
2,Equipment List,Inbound aircraft had Green System VERT(LY) Vertical LO PR event on Marker (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) on arrival. Inbound Captain told me the Green System VERT(LY) Vertical Hydraulic pressure went to zero. There were multiple previous discrepancies for green sys lo pressure and other green sys discrepancies. MX (Maintenance) took the aircraft and [Maintenance Control] told me parts were on the way from <Airport  (Domestic)> to fix the problem. Shortly after; I was informed that the aircraft had been returned to service with Minimum Equipment List 29-12-F Marker Warnings and Cautions for Eng Pump LO PRESS. I called [Maintenance Control] and inquired about the Minimum Equipment List. He told me that <Airport> MX did not like working on Airbus A/C and put the Minimum Equipment List on before consulting [Maintenance Control]. With many previous discrepancies; I did not feel that the Minimum Equipment List was appropriate for the current status of the aircraft. The aircraft was in a MX base.There seemed to be a lack of communication between the <Airport> MX base and [Maintenance Control].Better communication among all that were involved would have had a better potential outcome.
2,Equipment List,Refused aircraft due to four logbook entries in previous five days for Pack Reg Fault. System was reset and signed off twice as good to go; faulted again and was placed on Minimum Equipment List and cleared; faulted again and was cleared via part replacement. Maintenance Control stated wrong part was most likely replaced. Fault was present when I arrived at aircraft (after part was replaced). Maintenance Tech reset system; fault occurred again. Maintenance Supervisor wanted to Minimum Equipment List system again. Strongly suggest company comply with the spirit and intent of the Minimum Equipment List program and stop using it as a way to simply ensure on time performance and completion factor.
2,Equipment List,Just prior to push back; the Captain seen a new Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System  advisory message '24 Electrical Fault - EPC Inoperative.' As the Captain called Dispatch in order to talk to Maintenance; I began searching for the message in Chapter 2 of the A220 Minimum Equipment List/CDL; which is a message list for the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System . Before I was able to find the message; the Captain made contact with Maintenance and was told there was an Minimum Equipment List that could be applied. Having not seen this message before and being unable to find it in a timely manner; we trusted Maintenance Control and applied the CA (Crew Applied)-Minimum Equipment List XX-XX-XX-A. After reading the Minimum Equipment List we operated the aircraft on 3 legs; <Airport  (Domestic)>-<Airport>; <Airport>-ZZZ2; ZZZ2-<Airport>. At XA08 on Day 1; We received a message informing us that the Minimum Equipment List was applied in error and that the item was a no dispatch item. After further review of the A220 Minimum Equipment List/CDL; I was able to find the message and realized I missed the message when I was previously looking for it.
2,Equipment List,We picked up Aircraft X in <Airport  (Domestic)> for flight a to <Airport>.  After landing in <Airport> and later that night the crew that was taking the plane back to <Airport  (Domestic)> informed us while reviewing the logbook that Maintenance Control incorrectly placed an Minimum Equipment List on a discrepancy in ZZZ2 earlier in the day. The item was 24-ELECTRICAL FAULT EPC Inoperative.  Maintenance had placed the item on Minimum Equipment List.  We reviewed the Minimum Equipment List before flight. The outbound crew informed us that was the incorrect Minimum Equipment List and according to that item is a no dispatch.
2,Equipment List,Aircraft X. We arrived at the aircraft for our departure from <Airport  (Domestic)> when we began working through the multiple MELs. Minimum Equipment List 21-XX-XX-X was discussed and we could not locate the logbook entry required before each flight. Maintenance was notified and Contract Maintenance performed the test and logbook entry. We then had a Blower Fault Marker which was prohibited per the Minimum Equipment List. Contract Maintenance came back to the airplane and the test was performed again clearing the Blower Fault. We had failed to notice that per Minimum Equipment List 21-XX-XX-X there was a note stating Minimum Equipment List 21-XX-XY must also be applied. This Minimum Equipment List was not on our paperwork. We arrived in <Airport (Foreign)> and had coordinated with Maintenance Control to have Contract Maintenance there to perform the test. We received the Blower Fault with the test and Maintenance began troubleshooting the issue. Circuit Breaker AE02 was pulled and collared and the Mechanic stated this was not appropriate for Minimum Equipment List 21-XX-XX-X. The Mechanic worked with Maintenance and cleared the Blower Fault; pushed the Circuit Breaker in; and made a logbook entry per the Minimum Equipment List. While we were flying back to <Airport  (Domestic)> we began researching the history of this further. There had been multiple transfers from Minimum Equipment List 21-XX-XX-Y to Minimum Equipment List 21-XX-XX-Z and finally the night before our flight to Minimum Equipment List 21-XX-XX-X. We believed this is where the Circuit Breaker issue was probably missed. As we dug into this we also noticed the note to apply Minimum Equipment List 21-XX-XY (which was nowhere to be found on the paperwork or the logbook). We notified Dispatch and Maintenance of needing to speak to a Maintenance Supervisor and the Chief Pilot on Duty upon our arrival. The Captain made a phone call to the on call Chief Pilot and Maintenance to bring the issues to their attention. Contract Maintenance met us on the aircraft where we handed the aircraft over to them.
2,Equipment List,"I was scheduled to operate Aircraft X <Airport  (Domestic)> - <Airport> on Day 0. The aircraft was approximately 2 hours late inbound from ZZZ2. The delay was caused by a maintenance issue. While taxiing out in ZZZ2 the crew encountered an Marker for 'F/Control SPLR FAULT. They returned to the gate and Maintenance Control performed a reset. They then departed for <Airport  (Domestic)>. While enroute; the same fault reappeared. They wrote up the spoiler fault on arrival to <Airport  (Domestic)> and Maintenance Control came out to the aircraft. They performed a reset and signed off the logbook. We pushed back from the gate. During the first engine start; the Marker reappeared: F/Control SPLR FAULT. After completing the non-normal procedures for this Marker; we consulted the Computer Reset Table and followed the procedure to reset the spoiler fault. This reset was unsuccessful. The reset procedure specifically prohibits more than one reset attempt - so; after advising the flight attendants and customers; we returned to the gate. The same two maintenance control personnel returned to the aircraft. They advised me that Maintenance Control directed them to apply Minimum Equipment List 27-XX-XXX Spoiler Surfaces. This Minimum Equipment List allowed us to depart with one pair of symmetrical surfaces inoperative. They deactivated the inboard spoilers on each wing. The two technicians handed me the logbook and departed the aircraft. Several minutes later they returned and pulled and collared the circuit breaker for SEC 3. When I asked about this procedure they confirmed it was part of the task list to apply Minimum Equipment List 27-XX-XXX. They finished their work and we pushed back from the gate.After starting both engines I reviewed the Minimum Equipment List again. It advises that I should see the Marker ""Spoiler Fault."" We did not have that Marker displayed. I also examined the flight control system page and noticed that four of our spoilers were inoperative - not two as prescribed in the Minimum Equipment List. I also performed a flight control check and verified that four of our spoilers were not deploying. I could not reconcile the Minimum Equipment List guidance with what I was seeing on the flight deck. I then called Maintenance Control but could not get through. I called my Dispatcher and she was able to connect me to Maintenance Control. I described what I was observing and Maintenance Control told me ""that doesn't sound right."" He advised us to return to gate. I advised the crew and customers and we returned to the gate again. We were approaching the duty time limit so we deplaned the customers. The same two technicians returned to the aircraft. I was in the jet bridge talking with my crew when; after about 5 minutes; the technicians informed the gate agents that they were done and the aircraft was ""good to go."" They performed an incomplete Securing Checklist; shut off the Auxiliary Power Unit with customers still onboard; and departed without telling me anything they had done. The flight attendants and most of the customers were not comfortable returning to the same aircraft. I asked the gate agents to call the 2 technicians back out to the aircraft so they could explain to me what they had done to make the aircraft airworthy again. They explained to me that Maintenance Control had sent them the wrong task list and all they had to do was reset the circuit breaker for SEC 3. I confirmed with them that the flight control computer had been deactivated in error.After the second gate return; myself and First Officer exceeded our duty limit for the day and were removed from the flight. After explaining to my crew and most of the customers at the gate what had happened; we were able to re-board them and depart with two new pilots."""
2,Equipment List,I refused to accept the aircraft due to safety concerns. After reviewing the release prior to the flight; I noted Minimum Equipment List 22-XX. After reviewing the Minimum Equipment List; weather; airports; remaining duty day; current/future fitness for duty; experience/currency with conducting operations with manual thrust inputs; I decided it was unsafe to accept this aircraft. This inbound aircraft was delayed three hours arriving at <Airport  (Domestic)> due to an auto-thrust issue being worked in <Airport> by Maintenance. We had already flown from ZZZ2 to <Airport  (Domestic)> with three remaining segments. The aircraft was reassigned to us for our last three flights for the day. Per Minimum Equipment List; the alpha floor protection is lost without auto-thrust; and you must make manual inputs with the thrust levers i.e.; hand flying. Wind shear advisories/low level wind shear advisories were in the Automatic Terminal Information Service  reports. There were reports of icing out of <Airport  (Domestic)> and into ZZZ3 as well as gusting winds at each location. The <Fix / Intersection> arrival and visual Area Navigation XX approaches were being conducted at ZZZ3 and are rather complex. As the day would progress; the increased workload of having to hand fly the aircraft with the thrust levers on the remaining three flights in these conditions would have an impact on our fatigue/fitness for duty. Lastly; with all these factors considered and combined with the fact that this (hand flying the thrust levers) is something that is not commonly conducted outside of an annual sim ride; I made the decision to refuse the aircraft due to safety concerns. I notified Dispatch 1+10 hours prior to scheduled departure. I was asked the reason; and I said due to Minimum Equipment List 22-XX. They said they would notify the equipment manager. After the aircraft arrived; I proceeded to the gate to put a Captain's refusal entry in the logbook. To my surprise; the plane was almost completely boarded with passengers. I queried the gate agents and they said no one notified them of the refusal. I went to the aircraft and briefed the Flight Attendants (FAs); input the entry into the logbook; and then notified Maintenance of the entry. They were not aware of the refusal either. I returned to the gate agent desk and proceeded to call Dispatch back to make sure they understood I was not accepting the aircraft. They said they were waiting for me to put it in the logbook and then had to run it through the equipment manager and Duty Pilot. They finally sent word to deplane the passengers. About a half hour later; the Duty Pilot called me to discuss my reasoning/decision process for refusing the plane. Gave a few top reasons and ended it with I determined it unsafe and then the conversation ended. We were eventually assigned another aircraft and proceeded to conduct the flights to ZZZ3 and ZZZ4.It should be noted that my only other aircraft refusal; a couple months ago; was handled completely differently; it was professional; and no questions asked. When I called Dispatch to notify them of the refusal; they said no problem and no need to explain. We will find another aircraft for you. This latest experience was completely different. Dispatch waiting for an official entry; passengers boarded in the interim when they knew over an hour ahead of time I refused the aircraft; and then a call from the Duty Pilot to query/question my decision. Based on the factors above; safety of flight drove my decision to refuse the aircraft. Airbus was designed as an automated aircraft to reduce workload and enhance safety of flight. In addition; there are a number of protections designed into the aircraft to enhance safety as well. Without the automatic function of the auto thrust levers one of these protections is lost (alpha floor protection). When an aircraft comes thru a major hub (<Airport  (Domestic)>) with this type of issue; it should be fixed immediately. While I understand the Minimum Equipment List is a repair category (10 days); it doesn't necessarily mean that the aircraft is safe to fly based on certain/various conditions. These types of MELs (to include pack inop; Auxiliary Power Unit inop; etc) shouldbe given a higher priority for repair.
2,Equipment List,Prior to departure the airplane was dispatched with one pack on Minimum Equipment List. One of the requirements of that Minimum Equipment List is operational flight spoilers. SEC 1 failure with unsuccessful reset caused the failure of flight spoilers 3 and 4 on each wing. Accomplished Marker and North N Quick Reference Handbook procedure with no success of regaining SEC 1. SAT call to Maintenance Control; resets unsuccessful. Patched in with Dispatch and determined <Airport  (Domestic)> as the best airport for diversion. I determined it necessary to [request priority handling]; descend to 10000 feet and divert; due to the loss of some flight spoilers and the aircraft's capability to comply with the requirement of reaching 10000 feet in the required time in the event of the loss of the second pack or any other failure or incident that would require a descent.
2,Equipment List,The aircraft in question was ferried or repo'd from a heavy maintenance facility. Upon arrival at the aircraft it was quickly discovered that multiple discrepancies were present; both mechanical and in the cabin. In the cabin there was: 3 FA station emergency flashlights that were inoperable; an inoperable FA interphone/handset; life rafts that were installed backwards and upside down; aft galley POB's (Portable Oxygen Bottle) that were installed backwards; and wheelchair kits that were separated and stowed in incorrect areas throughout the cabin. Furthermore; and more importantly; there were the following mechanical discrepancies: ELT Minimum Equipment List required placard not installed; not reset to zero after landing; ISIS (Integrated Standby Instrument System) indicating approximately 5 degrees nose down attitude on ground (previous write up); and 'Service Check Required' write up in logbook while no such airworthiness release was signed off since. It should be noted that this aircraft had just returned from a heavy maintenance base/facility where it remained for over a month. It should also be noted that the aircraft sat on the ground in <Airport  (Domestic)>; after its arrival; for over 3 hours before our arrival at the aircraft. The fact that our frontline employees were forced to discover this plethora of discrepancies is incredibly concerning; especially after the aircraft was fresh from a heavy maintenance facility and ferried back to <Airport  (Domestic)> by management pilots. Not to mention the fact that there was literally no catering on the aircraft (considering the fact that it had spent over a month in heavy maintenance) and that when this was brought to the attention of local operations multiple times we were informed that because this flight was 'not on the schedule to be catered' that there was 'nothing they could do'. This entire situation was beyond shameful. A full flight was over 3 hours delayed because of this situation; which should have been entirely preventable. Thankfully we had a cabin crew assigned to this flight that was all-around beyond stellar and were able to keep our passengers calm and well-informed. We should be thankful for them. This entire situation was incredibly embarrassing; unnecessary; and shameful.
2,Equipment List,Diverted enroute due to a L WING LEAK Marker. We had ferried this aircraft the day prior; after the crew had reported the same Marker. They Minimum Equipment List'd the L bleed and we flew the flight to <Airport  (Domestic)>. Maintenance fixed the problem and we ferried the flight from <Airport  (Domestic)> to <Airport> for reposition.About 1.5 hours into the flight; near ZZZ2; we got the same L WING LEAK Marker. I gave Person A the radios and flight controls; and ran the Marker. After I completed the Marker; I went into the Frequency Modulation to see if anything else needed to be done. We read through that and then accessed the situation. We were now single bleed; single pack; the Minimum Equipment List from the day prior had a max altitude for this situation of 310. Although this Minimum Equipment List was not controlling; we felt it prudent to descend to at or below 310. Due to the L WING LEAK; being prohibited to fly in icing conditions; poor weather in ZZZ2; and with the lower altitude/lower landing fuel in ZZZ2 being significantly decreased; we decided to divert. We had fuel and time so we talked to dispatch and decided to divert to ZZZ3. We obtained NOTAMS; landing data; and went through the diversion guide. Once this was completed we had an uneventful approach and landing into ZZZ3.
2,Equipment List,Upon arrival to the aircraft reviewing the logbook; We learned that the aircraft had a deferral of SEC one (Spoiler Elevator Computer). After complying with the Minimum Equipment List Operations section; there are warnings to not use the speed brake in flight. I consulted the Dispatcher and told them that I was refusing the aircraft due to this limitation. A few minutes later; I was called by the Dispatch Duty pilot. Who asked me why I was refusing the aircraft when it's a legal Minimum Equipment List? I proceeded to tell him that I did not feel like it was safe. I gave him examples of procedures such as an emergency descent that requires use. He asked me if I would be willing to talk to tech so they could assure me that it was safe. I told him I was not going to change my decision. He said OK and hung up was then called by my base Chief Pilot who also asked me why I'm refusing this aircraft. I told him in the interest of safety. A few minutes later; I was called by tracking and told that I was given a missed Trip and was being removed from the flight because of my refusal. I immediately called my Chief Pilot and told him about the missed trip and he said he would have that removed. However; I would be docked the pay for the trip because I refused an aircraft with a legal Minimum Equipment List. I felt harassed and pushed as they were trying to get me to change my decision of refusing the aircraft. Cause: The Minimum Equipment List seems to not coincide with our procedures for an emergency descent.Suggestions: Not having an Minimum Equipment List that prohibits the use of a flight control surface necessary for our procedures.
